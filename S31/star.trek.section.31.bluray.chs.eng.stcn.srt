00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,297
还有那位瓦肯人
And we can't forget the Vulcan,

159
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:42,617
被舞台表演逗得哈哈大笑
laughing way too hard at the stage banter.

160
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:48,489
鉴于瓦肯人从来不笑
And since Vulcans never laugh,

161
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,889
他要么也是个白痴
he's either an idiot, too,

162
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:53,094
（* 瓦肯人每七年经历一次的发情时期）

163
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:53,094
要么就是在庞发*期间脑子变得不正常了
or lost his mind during pon farr and went insane.

164
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,031
拜托 那明明很好笑啊
Oh, come on. That was funny.

165
00:15:57,031 --> 00:16:00,117
还有你安排给他那个特别正经的人类搭档
And the very serious human you stuck him with...

166
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:01,569
你控制一下自己
Reel it in anytime.

167
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:04,277
她看着就是一副苦大仇深的样子
...she's got a stick so far up her backside,

168
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:05,717
一开口就能听出来
it's coming out her mouth.

169
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:07,342
冷静一点
Just reel it in.

170
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:13,197
那位是
That would be

171
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:14,777
加勒特上尉*
Lieutenant Garrett.

172
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:14,777
（* 瑞秋·加勒特 未来进取号-C的舰长 见《下一代》3x15）

173
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,857
星际舰队的
Starfleet.

174
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:22,023
无趣到死
Where fun goes to die.

175
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,293
你找我花了不少时间啊
It took you long enough to find me.

176
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:28,657
只要你留在巴拉姆空间站
We knew that having you here on the Baraam

177
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:30,598
对我们来说 总有一天会派上用场
would be valuable to us one day.

178
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:34,697
好吧 我不得不说我一点儿也不感动
Well, I'm not feeling motivated to be valuable

179
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:37,171
我只为自己所用
to anyone but myself.

180
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,479
今夜请说愿意
♪ Say yes tonight ♪

181
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:47,937
一切都可应允
♪ Say yes to everything... ♪

182
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:51,285
所以 我们就这么开始谈判吗
So, is this where we start negotiating?

183
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:53,487
那要看情况了
Hmm, that depends.

184
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:55,657
你们是何时发现我的
How long have you known about me?

185
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:58,477
从你自前任站主那儿接手开始 我们就知道了
Ever since you took over from the previous owner,

186
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,227
而那位站主到现在依然下落不明
who we still haven't found.

187
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,397
其他的前站主也是
Well, all of.

188
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:02,637
这可不是我干的
That wasn't me.

189
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:03,698
乔久皇帝
Emperor Georgiou,

190
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:06,397
我完全有权逮捕你
I am authorized to arrest you

191
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:08,397
抹除你的记忆
and wipe your mind clean.

192
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:09,537
但是话又说回来 我心里还是觉得
But then again, there's a part of me

193
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:12,160
你更应当背负那些不堪回忆而活
that wants you to live with your memories.

194
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,542
尤其种族灭绝的那些
The genocidal ones.

195
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:18,480
你有权逮捕我
Being authorized to arrest me

196
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,457
不等于你有能力逮捕我
isn't the same as being able to arrest me.

197
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:25,537
你真的希望31区 希望我
You really want Section 31-- want me--

198
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:27,221
不止不休地追着你吗
dogging you until the end of time?

199
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,657
无聊
Boring.

200
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:33,094
往事如影随形啊
The past always catches up with you.

201
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,537
既然我们都不希望如此
And as much as both of us might hate it, 

202
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:37,617
我会帮你个忙
I'm doing you a favor.

203
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,377
最后一次任务
One last mission.

204
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:42,904
听着
Listen.

205
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:46,177
你相信命运吗
Do you believe in fate?

206
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:47,742
我信
Because I do.

207
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:49,944
你无处可逃
You can't hide from it.

208
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:53,347
乔久 你在这里什么都不是
You're nothing here, Georgiou.

209
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,554
现在我给你一个机会
I'm giving you a chance to get back in.

210
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:02,524
参与这场跨越银河的行动
In on the action on a galactic scale.

211
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,959
别再逃避了
Stop running from it.

212
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:09,330
成为你本该成为的人
Be who you are.

213
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:15,281
或者就在这个酒吧待一辈子
Or stay and tend bar for eternity.

214
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,856
那就抓紧开始吧
Let's get on with it.

215
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:38,059
菲莉帕·乔久 认识一下我的团队
Philippa Georgiou, meet my team.

216
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,794
这是梅尔
This is Melle.

217
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:43,717
泽弗
Zeph.

218
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:46,568
你看起来像一把瑞士军刀
You look like a Swiss Army knife.

219
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:49,571
等等
Uh, hold on.

220
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:51,138
我不知道那是什么意思
I don't know what that means, but I'm not gonna

221
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:52,373
但我不可能傻站在这里被你侮辱
just stand here and get insulted.

222
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:53,941
我没说你
I'm not talking about you.

223
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,810
我是说你的装甲
I'm talking about your suit.

224
00:18:57,411 --> 00:18:58,913
鉴于你是新来的
Um, you're new,

225
00:18:58,913 --> 00:19:00,982
所以我就解释这一回
so I'm gonna just explain this one time

226
00:19:00,982 --> 00:19:04,157
当你在说我这套装甲的时候
that when you are talking about the suit,

227
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:05,252
就是在说我
you're talking about Zeph.

228
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,477
泽弗有点机械变形障碍症 大概
Zeph suffers from what we call mecha dysmorphia.

229
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:10,017
我也许不知道那是啥意思
And I may not know what that is,

230
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:11,797
但我也不接受你这说法
but I'm also not gonna take that from you, 

231
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:13,260
小夸 我觉得你冒犯了我
Quas, and personally I'm offended.

232
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,477
-我觉得你应当知道  -这挺对的
- I think you should know... - Well, it's accurate.

233
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:15,817
你不能诊断我得了什么 你不是医生
It's not a diagnosis. You're not a doctor.

234
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:17,331
泽弗 泽弗 泽弗
Zeph. Zeph, Zeph!

235
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:18,857
-他知道 他知道 别吵了 -好吧
- He knows. He knows. He knows. - Okay, fine.

236
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:19,834
他知道
He knows.

237
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:21,035
-他明白的 他明白的 -是的
- He gets it. He gets it. - Yes.

238
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,571
行了 那位瓦肯人呢
Okay, what about that Vulcan?

239
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:26,040
没人跟她说吗
Nobody told her?

240
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:29,548
你说这个吗 正跟你说话的这个东西
This? The thing you're talking to?

241
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,457
这个瓦肯外表不过是台机器
The Vulcan's just a machine.

242
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:33,280
我在里面
I'm inside.

243
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,316
操控它
Driving.

244
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:46,494
我通过体内的备用驾驶舱控制这具身体
I control the body from a backup vehicle.

245
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:49,295
这是我专门用来在狭窄空间里进出的小玩意
Yeah, something I use to get into tight spots.

246
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:51,464
你好啊
Hi there.

247
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,500
我是法兹
I'm Fuzz.

248
00:19:54,637 --> 00:19:56,137
法兹是纳米人
Fuzz is a Nanokin.

249
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:57,857
一个天性爱玩的家伙
Real fun-loving guy.

250
00:19:58,237 --> 00:19:59,377
你好
Hello.

251
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:01,697
除非他哪天不感兴趣了
Except for when he's not.

252
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:03,397
然后他就会变成一个易暴易怒的人了
Then he's deranged with an anger management problem.

253
00:20:03,397 --> 00:20:05,412
你该说完第一句就闭嘴的 夸西
Well, you could've stopped at the first thing, Quasi.

254
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:08,957
一个非法制造的瓦肯型运输载体
A bootleg Vulcan conveyance?

255
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:12,917
你肯定在黑市上见过不少了不得的东西
You must see cool stuff on the black market.

256
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,517
纳米人都是天生的拾荒者
Nanokins are pretty scavengery.

257
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:16,977
31区在废弃的船只上发现了虫害 
31 made first contact when we 

258
00:20:16,977 --> 00:20:18,937
然后才有了第一次接触
discovered an infestation on a derelict ship.

259
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:19,577
夸西
Quasi.

260
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:20,577
啊 糟了
Oh, shit.

261
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:24,037
夸西 你再说一遍「虫害」试试看
Say "infestation" one more time, Quasi.

262
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:27,017
叫我拾荒者 你这袋没形状的烟灰
Say "scavenger," you sack of amorphous soot!

263
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,717
我 我一顺口就说出来了
I-I s-- I heard it as soon as I said it.

264
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:29,837
我真想好好揍你一顿
I will kick your ass

265
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,117
直到你变成一团液体的…
until you cannot form a solid mass of...

266
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:34,037
法兹 情绪控制一下
Fuzz. Fuzz. Lock it down.

267
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:35,409
我已经够冷静了
I am locked down.

268
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:41,649
我被困在一个巨大的瓦肯机器脑袋里
I'm trapped inside a giant robot Vulcan head.

269
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:45,219
此刻没人比我更「冷静」了
No one is more locked down than me right now!

270
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:48,117
纳米人情绪光谱不太稳定
Nanokins have a wonky emotional spectrum.

271
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:49,477
不不不不行
No, no, no, no, no, no, 

272
00:20:49,477 --> 00:20:51,477
不许用居高临下的态度对我 梅尔
I will not be condescended to, Melle,

273
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:52,726
尤其是你 因为说实话
particularly not by you, because honest...

274
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:55,097
我爱你 你就是一切
I love you. You are everything.

275
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:57,177
你喜欢我复杂的情绪光谱吗
Does my spectrum work for you?

276
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:59,100
我意思是 你是认真的吗 还是说
I mean, like, like, are you into it or...

277
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,066
法兹
Fuzz!

278
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,569
她在侮辱你 老兄
She's insulting you, pal.

279
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:05,097
我就知道德尔塔人又会做他们德尔塔人的那一套
I know Deltans are gonna do their Deltan thing,

280
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,473
但是自尊自爱点吧 伙计
but have a little self-respect, would you?

281
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,640
能继续任务了吗
Can we continue?

282
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,417
然后这位是瑞秋·加勒特上尉
And that's Lieutenant Rachel Garrett.

283
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:12,677
她仅为这次任务被临时派往31区
She is detailed to Section 31 for this one mission only.

284
00:21:12,677 --> 00:21:15,297
上尉 你得罪了谁才被派来这个秘密组织?
Who did you piss off to get stuck in black ops, Lieutenant?

285
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:20,117
派个星际舰队的人进来是确保我们行事合规
Starfleet is here to make sure we color inside the lines.

286
00:21:20,117 --> 00:21:22,137
我参与本次行动的目的是保卫联邦
Starfleet is here to defend the Federation,

287
00:21:22,137 --> 00:21:24,626
维持和平状态并确保不发生谋杀事件
keep the peace and make sure no one commits murder.

288
00:21:26,057 --> 00:21:27,161
那你呢
And you?

289
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:27,657
等一下
One moment.

290
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:28,596
我认识夸西是因为
Quasi came on my radar

291
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:31,957
他证明了神经胶质细胞簇的存在
when he proved the existence of glioclusters.

292
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,036
神经胶质细胞簇只存在于理论中
Glioclusters are theoretical.

293
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:36,569
曾经是
Formerly theoretical.

294
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,340
生命充满无限可能
Life is just branching possibilities.

295
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,840
它们以你能想象的任何方式盛开
You know, they bloom and blossom any way you can imagine.

296
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,577
比如 我现在可能会被你吓倒
For example, I could be intimidated by you right now.

297
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:48,257
毕竟你杀了那么多人
I mean, after all, you've murdered so many people...

298
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:51,251
而且你好像能看透我的灵魂
and you seem to be staring right into my soul.

299
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,021
我可以对此做出回应
I could respond to that

300
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,237
或者我可以观察我的感受
or I could observe my feelings right now,

301
00:21:56,237 --> 00:21:58,277
不管它 只做我需要做的事
lock it away and do what I need to do.

302
00:21:58,277 --> 00:21:59,057
或者说
Or...

303
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:00,862
小夸 选一个好吗
Quas. Pick one. Hmm?

304
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:03,697
- 好吧 - 有时夸西看到了太多可能性
- Yes. - Sometimes Quasi sees so many options 

305
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,917
以至于他的思维可能会有所停滞
he gets brain-freeze.

306
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:05,757
多谢夸奖呢 梅尔
Thank you, Melle.

307
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,502
夸西 我们能继续了吗
Quasi, can we carry on, please?

308
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:11,837
我们的目标是达达·诺尔
Our target's name is Dada Noe.

309
00:22:11,837 --> 00:22:13,273
一个有道德底线在哪都存疑的家伙
Dubious moral compass.

310
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:16,477
在他叛变之前 他在瓦特殖民地经营着一个病理学实验室
Ran a pathology lab on the Watt Colonies before he went rogue.

311
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:19,997
自那以后 他便开始替人定制生化武器
Since then, he's been designing bioweapons on spec.

312
00:22:19,997 --> 00:22:21,617
诺尔前往巴拉姆空间站是为了
Noe's on his way to the Baraam 

313
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:24,037
把他的最新发明出手给米诺斯最高议会
to sell his latest creation to the Minosian High Council.

314
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:27,477
目前我们与米诺斯统治体之间并无正式敌对状态
There are no formal hostilities with the Minosian Sway,

315
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:28,517
但若他们拿到这件武器 
but that could change 

316
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:30,297
情况可能会发生变化
if they get their hands on a superweapon.

317
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:32,537
有任何关于这个超级生物武器的信息吗
Do we know what this bio superweapon is?

318
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:34,777
没有 但要是诺尔成功出售就坏了
No, but if Dada Noe is selling it, it's bad.

319
00:22:34,777 --> 00:22:37,732
所以你的任务目标就是确保交易不会发生
So you're here to make sure the sale never happens.

320
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:40,208
怎么做
How?

321
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,400
你对我们行动的发觉确实造成了一些影响
Things went south when you spotted us,

322
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,077
但计划仍然可靠
but the plan is still solid.

323
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:49,037
首先 阿洛克会
First, Alok was going to...

324
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,912
你说吧
You can say it.

325
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:54,657
和你亲密接触
Connect. With you.

326
00:22:55,997 --> 00:22:57,517
欢迎
Welcome!

327
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,477
异想天开啊
What a cute idea.

328
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:05,457
一旦我们适当的分散了你的注意力
Once we had you suitably distracted,

329
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:08,562
就轮到夸西做他擅长的事了
Quasi would do the other thing Quasi does.

330
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,157
好了 夸西
Okay, Quasi.

331
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:12,357
麻烦你了
If you would do the honors.

332
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,537
没问题
Absolutely.

333
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,576
我们开始吧
Let's get to work.

334
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,718
欢迎欢迎 达达·诺尔
Welcome, Dada Noe.

335
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:32,854
这时候法兹会参与进来
This is where Fuzz comes in.

336
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:41,095
你绝对想不到我能进入多小的地方
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

337
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:45,499
比如 身体改造组件的内部空间
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

338
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:48,135
只要我进入达达的身体改造组件里
Oh, once I fly inside Dada's body mod,

339
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,237
这就是我要发挥作用的时刻
well, then it's time to get to work.

340
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:51,877
这么多电路
So many circuits.

341
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:54,208
太多可能出错的东西了
So many things that could go wrong.

342
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:57,110
我们这位全副武装的十字军战士
Competency crusader here will talk me through

343
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:58,578
会通过植入物跟我交谈
the tech on the implant.

344
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:00,848
如果我认为我们通过达达·诺尔的植入物
And if I think we're putting Dada Noe's life in danger

345
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:02,557
让他生命垂危
by tinkering with that implant,

346
00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:04,977
我会通过星际舰队
I will unleash the full weight of Starfleet

347
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,353
对此次任务施压
on this whole operation.

348
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:09,277
嘿 我们讨论的可是一个要出售超级武器的家伙
Oy, we're talking about a bloke who's selling superweapons

349
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:10,957
他会把东西卖给任何有拉蒂金卡的三流恐怖分子
to any third-rate terrorist with a Latinum card.

350
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:12,737
听仔细了 满脑子废品的家伙
Listen carefully, Junkyard.

351
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:15,757
星际舰队不执行暗杀任务
Starfleet does not do assassinations.

352
00:24:15,757 --> 00:24:18,337
唉 别再满脑子的惦记着你的最高指导原则了
Ay, don't get your prime directives in a bunch.

353
00:24:18,337 --> 00:24:20,497
不会让你亲自下场弄脏手的
You are not going to get your hands dirty

354
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:22,797
也不会坏了你升舰长的前程
and mess up your chances of becoming captain.

355
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:24,171
我可是顶尖科学官
I'm a top-tier science officer.

356
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,200
屁股拧成麻花了
Butt pretzel.

357
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,517
就是个死板精
Tight-ass.

358
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:27,957
真是太不尊重人了
So disrespectful.

359
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:30,144
只要加勒特和法兹切断了组件的链接
Soon as Garrett and Fuzz sever that link...

360
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:34,457
他就随便我们拿捏了
...he'll be under our control, 

361
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:36,317
我会和泽弗一起制服他
and I'll take him down with the help of Zeph.

362
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:45,077
一下搞定
That's what I call a hit.

363
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:45,597
只需一下
One.

364
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:47,493
达达·诺尔会被拘留 他的病原体会被没收
Dada Noe and his pathogen will be in custody

365
00:24:47,494 --> 00:24:50,331
这一切会在卖家出现在巴拉姆空间站之前就完成
before the buyers can even show up to the Baraam.

366
00:24:50,737 --> 00:24:52,377
速战速决
And we are in and out.

367
00:24:52,377 --> 00:24:53,637
呃
Mm.

368
00:24:53,637 --> 00:24:55,177
算了
Meh.

369
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,571
啥
Meh?

370
00:24:58,017 --> 00:24:59,817
我有个更简单的办法
I have a simpler idea.

371
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:02,877
表情很绝望 我看的出来
♪ Desperate, I can tell ♪

372
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:05,079
所有的祈求
♪ All that begging ♪

373
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,114
都像是为你量身定做的
♪ Suits you well. ♪

374
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:09,983
现在打爆我的手机
♪ Blowing up my phone now ♪

375
00:25:09,984 --> 00:25:12,086
我向上 你低头
♪ Going up, you bow down ♪

376
00:25:12,086 --> 00:25:14,654
看看是谁需要谁
♪ Look at who needs who... ♪

377
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:17,391
欢迎欢迎 达达·诺尔先生
Welcome, Monsieur Dada Noe.

378
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,697
您的到来使巴拉姆空间站蓬荜生辉
We're honored to have you here at the Baraam.

379
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:23,217
我是维罗妮卡·杜·弗朗克 这里的店主
I am Veronique du Franc, the proprietor.

380
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,197
我早就预约我的套间了吧
I told them to have my suite ready.

381
00:25:25,197 --> 00:25:26,437
当然 先生
Mais oui, monsieur.

382
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:28,501
请允许我带您到房间里
May I escort you to your quarters?

383
00:25:28,877 --> 00:25:29,937
请随我来
Come.

384
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:33,274
我们有最好的…
We have the most exquisite...

385
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:35,297
我简直不敢相信你会信任这个反社会的疯子
I can't believe you're trusting this sociopath.

386
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:36,157
上尉
Well, Lieutenant,

387
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:37,677
你做好自己的事
you got to do what you got to do,

388
00:25:37,678 --> 00:25:39,057
我知道怎么跟反社会疯子打交道
and I'm kind of familiar with sociopaths.

389
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:41,115
我说了别带我来
I said don't bring me.

390
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:45,752
我想您的旅程一切顺利 先生
I trust your trip was without incident, monsieur.

391
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:49,137
你的团队倒是帮我把一切都打点好了
Well, your people made everything easy.

392
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:50,437
不胜荣幸
Our pleasure.

393
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:51,597
我们到了
Here we are.

394
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,557
太俗气了
So tacky.

395
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:03,004
但我想这就是你出名的地方
But I guess that's what you're known for.

396
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:09,602
这是什么？
What's this?

397
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:11,003
这东西叫相位转移器
It's called a phase pod.

398
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:13,380
我的某位客户送给我的礼物
A client of mine gave it to me as a gift,

399
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,715
我自己也有一个
and I got one for myself, too.

400
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:26,927
你在做什么
What are you doing?

401
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:28,629
宇宙中的一切
Everything in the universe vibrates

402
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,230
都以特定的波长振动
on a certain wavelength.

403
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:32,178
该死
Damn it.

404
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:35,236
把箱子还给我
Give me back my case.

405
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:36,637
我拒绝
No.

406
00:26:38,427 --> 00:26:41,102
维修费从你的押金里出
That's coming out of your security deposit.

407
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:43,744
相位转移器则会改变
The phase pod changes the wavelength

408
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:45,346
接触到的任何东西的物质波长
of whatever they touch.

409
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,860
我和你不在同一相位 你也不和我在同一相位
I am out of phase with you, and you're out of phase with me.

410
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,786
但是我 跟你的箱子在同一相位
I am, however, in phase with your case.

411
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:57,577
然后我会把它拿走
And I will be taking it with me.

412
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:01,395
你根本不知道你挑起了什么
You have no idea what you've started.

413
00:27:03,597 --> 00:27:05,266
哎呀
Whoopsie.

414
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:12,138
不错嘛
Impressive.

415
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:13,727
你真的是普通人类吗
Are you sure you're human?

416
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:15,977
多数时候是
Most days.

417
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:17,511
谢谢你
Thank you.

418
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:53,247
把箱子给我
Give me the case.

419
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:26,613
你是谁
Who are you?

420
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,559
他从那儿走了 那儿那儿 走那边
He went that way. That way, that way, that way!

421
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:52,239
哇 外星人
Oh, aliens.

422
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:53,227
还是裸体的
Naked aliens.

423
00:28:53,227 --> 00:28:54,215
泽弗 快追
Go, Zeph, go.

424
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:16,063
他往休息室去了 天哪 他们走得真快
He's headed to the lounge. Man, they're moving fast.

425
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:17,730
梅尔 他朝你来了
Melle, he's coming to you.

426
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:21,468
哎呀
Yikes.

427
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:33,340
没事没事 我还好
No, it's okay. I'm all right.

428
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,177
梅尔 有看到目标吗
Melle, you got him?

429
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:34,852
看到了
Got him.

430
00:29:38,452 --> 00:29:39,427
哎呀
Ooh-la-la!

431
00:29:39,427 --> 00:29:40,887
嗨 亲爱的
Ay, amor.

432
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,877
不可能
That's not possible.

433
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,154
它已经被我销毁了
I had that destroyed.

434
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:56,422
不
No. No!

435
00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:00,527
这不可能
It's not possible.

436
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:01,677
你知道那件武器
You knew that weapon.

437
00:32:01,677 --> 00:32:02,852
是什么
What is it?

438
00:32:05,552 --> 00:32:06,777
回答我
What is it?

439
00:32:09,102 --> 00:32:11,872
行 那就来硬的
Fine. The hard way.

440
00:32:44,852 --> 00:32:47,477
永恒的祈求者恳请觐见
The Eternal Supplicant begs approach.

441
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,760
（人族帝国）

442
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,160
（人族帝国）
（上辈子）

443
00:32:44,852 --> 00:32:47,477
永恒的祈求者恳请觐见
The Eternal Supplicant begs approach.

444
00:32:47,477 --> 00:32:49,042
准了
You have my permission.

445
00:32:56,552 --> 00:32:59,177
参见至高无上的女皇陛下
All hail Her Most Imperial Majesty,

446
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,287
崇上国母
Mother of the Fatherland,

447
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:01,852
-瓦肯领主  -你带来的是什么
- Overlord of Vulc... - What is it?

448
00:33:03,457 --> 00:33:05,359
它完成了 陛下
It is finished, Your Majesty.

449
00:33:08,677 --> 00:33:10,311
我的工程师们在哪
Where are my engineers?

450
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:15,969
他们 他们在完工后结束了自己的生命
They... they took their own lives upon completion.

451
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:23,577
你在为谁流泪 桑
Who is the tear for, San?

452
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,648
说
Speak.

453
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:30,751
是为您 陛下
It is for you, Majesty.

454
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:33,787
这都是
It is all...

455
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:37,591
为了您
...for you.

456
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:49,269
我再问你 桑
I asked you a question, San.

457
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:52,739
你为何为我而哭
Why do you cry for me?

458
00:33:57,427 --> 00:33:58,452
看着我
Look at me.

459
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:05,752
你还记得我们是谁吗
Do you remember who we were?

460
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,022
在这一切之前
Before all this.

461
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:11,857
好奇的男孩
The curious boy.

462
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:14,628
天真的女孩
The innocent girl.

463
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:18,077
我只记得我的失败 陛下
I only remember my failure, Majesty.

464
00:34:18,077 --> 00:34:20,934
别对我撒谎
Don't lie to me.

465
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:29,208
为了活下去 我们付出了别人无法想象的代价
We were the only ones who could understand the cost to stay alive.

466
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:32,045
我们是一个集体
We made a team.

467
00:34:32,045 --> 00:34:35,777
彼此依靠 不可分割
We needed each other, didn't we?

468
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:41,587
记得那时我们是靠着什么话语 彼此支撑着活下来的吗
What did we say to carry each other through, to survive together?

469
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:43,424
我们虽为两人
We are two...

470
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:46,927
但为一体
But one.

471
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:49,463
我们虽为两人 但为一体
We are two but one.

472
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:51,732
如果我说
If I said then,

473
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:53,233
「我们逃跑吧」
"Let's run away,

474
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:55,227
「逃离这场竞争」
"let's flee this competition

475
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:57,937
「以及把我们和人族联系在一起的一切」
and everything that binds us to Terra,"

476
00:34:57,938 --> 00:35:00,306
你会说什么呢
what would you have said?

477
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:07,681
您问这个问题的时机 比您认为的更富意味
The timing of your question is more poetic than you know.

478
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,646
我会答应您
I would have said yes.

479
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,327
只会在当时
Then.

480
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:25,127
那么现在呢
But now?

481
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:31,827
您本可以在您的治下创造一些美好的东西
You could have made something beautiful with your reign.

482
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:34,652
然而 您却选择了让人制造此物
Instead, you chose to build this.

483
00:35:34,652 --> 00:35:37,502
这意味着我熟知的那个天真女孩
That means that innocent girl I knew,

484
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,846
她已经
she has been...

485
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:42,727
死了
...murdered.

486
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,885
怎么回事
What is this?

487
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,820
你
You...

488
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:50,657
你服用了一样的毒药?
You took the same poison?

489
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:55,077
不 我不许你死
No! I forbid you to die!

490
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:58,552
没有人愿意活在
No one wants to live

491
00:35:58,552 --> 00:36:01,502
您的统治中 皇帝
in your world, Emperor.

492
00:36:01,502 --> 00:36:04,571
你就是个怪物
You are a monster!

493
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:35,677
这是什么令人愉快的地方
And what delightful place is this?

494
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:36,802
一个安全屋
A safe house.

495
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:39,505
但对你而言也许不是
But maybe not so safe for you.

496
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:41,452
既然你是31区的
You are Section 31.

497
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:44,427
你为什么不拷问我以获取答案
Why aren't you torturing answers out of me?

498
00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:46,127
你是个暴君
You're a tyrant.

499
00:36:46,127 --> 00:36:47,527
货真价实的
A real one.

500
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:49,227
折磨起不到半点作用
Torture wouldn't work.

501
00:36:49,227 --> 00:36:52,217
你怎么会这么了解我这种人呢
How do you know so much about people like me?

502
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,924
是在哪里学来的暴君手段 而且学得很到位
You learned tyranny somewhere, and you learned hard.

503
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:01,294
藏着掖着 只证明了你的软弱
If you have to hide it, that's a weakness.

504
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:06,365
而我 不能容许搭档有这种弱点
And I can't have that in a partner.

505
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:07,702
我们可算不上搭档
We're not partners.

506
00:37:07,702 --> 00:37:08,852
不是吗
No?

507
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,852
我可是帮了大忙了
I've been very helpful.

508
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:12,777
你的计划行不通
You had a plan that couldn't work.

509
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:13,852
而我给了你更好的
I gave you a better one.

510
00:37:13,852 --> 00:37:16,302
你让我尝到了那种刺激
You gave me a taste of the action,

511
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:17,978
还明知道我会上瘾
knowing I'd want more.

512
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:21,247
你需要我
You need me.

513
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:23,483
你选择了我
You chose me.

514
00:37:25,551 --> 00:37:26,653
为什么呢
Why?

515
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:29,077
不管你认为你的任务是什么
Whatever you believed your mission was,

516
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:31,252
这远比你想象的更糟糕
it's worse than you thought.

517
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:35,677
事关数亿万生命 时间紧迫
Billions of lives are at stake, and time is short.

518
00:37:35,677 --> 00:37:39,465
你先让我了解你 我才能告诉你
Tell me you, and I will tell you me.

519
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:43,527
要想合作 我得知根知底
The only way this works is if I know exactly

520
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,627
说出你的身份
who I'm dealing with.

521
00:37:57,217 --> 00:37:59,527
我也不属于这个时代
I'm not from this time, either.

522
00:38:01,202 --> 00:38:03,527
我出生于20世纪的地球
I was born on Earth, 20th century.

523
00:38:03,527 --> 00:38:07,027
这么说你已经350岁高龄了
You are 350 years old?

524
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:08,428
差不多
More or less.

525
00:38:08,428 --> 00:38:10,864
大部分时间我在冬眠舱里
I slept most of that time.

526
00:38:12,427 --> 00:38:13,834
在我被流放之后
After my exile.

527
00:38:16,637 --> 00:38:18,839
优生战争
The Eugenics Wars.

528
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:25,145
强化人
Augments...

529
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:26,747
夺走了我的星球
took my planet.

530
00:38:28,048 --> 00:38:30,050
我的家乡
My home.

531
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:38,524
当时我们差不多有十个人在战斗
There was maybe ten of us who fought.

532
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,995
我认识的人不是挨了一枪就是挨了一刀
Everyone I knew either took a bullet or a blade.

533
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:44,962
我也还以颜色
But I gave some back.

534
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,734
这让她注意到了我
She noticed me.

535
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:52,271
那个屠杀我家人的强化人
The Augment who slaughtered my family.

536
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:57,343
他们叫她 被标记的吉里
They called her Giri the Marked.

537
00:38:57,343 --> 00:38:59,178
她收留了我
She took me in.

538
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:02,577
让我比任何人类都强大
Made me stronger than any human should be.

539
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:04,452
她把我撕成碎片
She ripped me apart

540
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:07,519
然后把我重塑成了她军队里的又一个强化人
and turned me into another Augment for her army.

541
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,877
我做了很多可怕的事
And I did terrible things.

542
00:39:10,877 --> 00:39:15,028
却是为你这样的怪物效力
All for a monster like you.

543
00:39:16,797 --> 00:39:20,827
因为对于暴君来说 永远只有一个选择
Because for tyrants, there is only one choice:

544
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,837
杀戮
murder.

545
00:39:25,138 --> 00:39:26,900
但你却没杀掉我
You haven't killed me.

546
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,910
暂时而已
Yet.

547
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:37,877
我之所以能认出那个武器
I recognized the weapon because

548
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:40,902
因为它是我下令造的
I ordered it to be built.

549
00:39:43,452 --> 00:39:45,127
召集你的人手
Gather your people.

550
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:47,427
每个人都得派上用场
We're gonna need every one of them.

551
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,920
（加密传讯2）

552
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,380
（加密传讯2）
（天赐之物）

553
00:40:24,377 --> 00:40:25,977
在我的宇宙里
In my universe,

554
00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:27,577
阴谋重重 政敌环伺
there were always plotters.

555
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:29,040
政变层出不穷
Always a coup.

556
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,352
所以我造了一件武器来终结所有威胁
So I built a weapon to end all threats.

557
00:40:33,252 --> 00:40:35,277
我称之为
I called it

558
00:40:35,277 --> 00:40:36,627
「天赐之物」
the Godsend.

559
00:40:37,652 --> 00:40:39,577
它会引发一种连锁反应
It triggers a chain reaction,

560
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:42,102
就像病毒一样在群星间传播
like a virus passing between planets.

561
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:44,583
所到之处 一切都将化为灰烬
Everything in its path incinerates.

562
00:40:44,584 --> 00:40:47,527
整个象限都会消失
An entire quadrant would be lost.

563
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:49,977
如果我的敌人成功杀死了我
If my enemies managed to kill me,

564
00:40:49,977 --> 00:40:52,725
那也不会有东西留给他统治
there would be nothing left to rule.

565
00:40:55,527 --> 00:40:57,302
有个小问题
Yeah, hi. Quick question.

566
00:40:57,302 --> 00:40:57,864
不好意思
Sorry.

567
00:40:57,864 --> 00:41:00,102
就一个很小很小的问题
Yeah, no. Uh, just a qu-- it's just a quick one.

568
00:41:00,102 --> 00:41:03,536
这是天赐之物还是天赐之暮
Is it Godsend or God's End?

569
00:41:04,702 --> 00:41:05,877
天赐之物还是天赐之暮
Godsend or God's End?

570
00:41:05,877 --> 00:41:07,327
我不明白你说的有什么区别
I don't hear a difference in what you're saying.

571
00:41:07,327 --> 00:41:10,752
听不出来吗 「物」和「暮」
Really? Really? Godsend. God's End.

572
00:41:10,752 --> 00:41:11,652
我还是没听明白
Yeah, I'm still not getting it.

573
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:12,652
天赐之物是...
The Godsend is...

574
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:14,477
噢 天赐之物 我现在听清楚了
Wait, Godsend. I hear it now.

575
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:16,252
-天赐之物 不是暮  -物
- It's Godsend. No apostrophe. - Send.

576
00:41:16,252 --> 00:41:17,818
天赐之物就在这个宇宙
The Godsend is here.

577
00:41:17,818 --> 00:41:20,377
怎么会 那可是另一个宇宙的物品
How? It's from another universe.

578
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,127
我不知道 但那个人刚刚就拿着它
I don't know, but that man had it.

579
00:41:22,127 --> 00:41:23,877
你以为是达达·诺伊的那个人
The one that you think is Dada Noe.

580
00:41:24,402 --> 00:41:25,902
我们都知道是达达·诺伊的那个人
The one we know is Dada Noe.

581
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:29,077
不 他不可能是你们的达达·诺伊 
No, he's not your Dada Noe. He can't be.

582
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:30,502
他来自人族帝国
He's from the Terran Empire,

583
00:41:30,502 --> 00:41:32,002
是他把天赐之物带来这里
and he brought the Godsend here.

584
00:41:32,002 --> 00:41:34,852
不然他根本不可能知道那到底是什么
That's the only way he can know about it.

585
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:36,702
既然我们已经抓到他了
And since we have him locked up tight,

586
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,077
我要亲自审讯他
I'll interrogate him.

587
00:41:38,077 --> 00:41:40,152
绝对不行 不能信这个女人说的话
No, no, no. We cannot trust a single word this woman says.

588
00:41:40,152 --> 00:41:40,877
是啊
Yeah.

589
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:42,327
她害死了梅尔
She cost us Melle.

590
00:41:42,327 --> 00:41:44,377
只有她知道我们面对的是什么人
She's the only one who knows what we're dealing with.

591
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,252
也就是她自己说的 小兄弟
Yeah, well, so she says, little bro.

592
00:41:46,252 --> 00:41:46,927
小?
Little?

593
00:41:47,827 --> 00:41:49,452
这是身材羞辱
Scale-shamer!

594
00:41:49,452 --> 00:41:51,252
微生物比恐龙更长寿
Microbes outlasted dinosaurs!

595
00:41:51,252 --> 00:41:52,977
冷静点 我要说的是
Calm your boots. What I'm saying is...

596
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,988
我要尿在你的装甲上 直到你全身生锈
I will piss in your suit until you go all rusty like!

597
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:57,677
这一切都是她搞砸的
...that she's the reason this is all bollixed up.

598
00:41:57,677 --> 00:41:59,002
她导致了梅尔的死
She's the reason Melle's dead, 

599
00:41:59,002 --> 00:42:01,152
她也是我们被派来这的原因
and she's the reason we're in the ass end of the galaxy.

600
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,295
听好了
Listen up.

601
00:42:05,327 --> 00:42:07,452
乔久和我回船上去
Georgiou and I are gonna go back to the ship.

602
00:42:07,452 --> 00:42:09,877
达达·诺伊是我们与天赐之物的唯一联系
Dada Noe is our only link to the Godsend,

603
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:13,606
所以我们要找他谈谈
so we're gonna have a little chat with him.

604
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,420
干什么
What?

605
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,354
她叫菲利帕·乔久
Her name is Philippa Georgiou,

606
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:31,402
至高无上的女皇陛下
Her Most Imperial Majesty.

607
00:42:31,402 --> 00:42:33,025
崇上国母
Mother of the Fatherland.

608
00:42:33,026 --> 00:42:34,527
瓦肯领主
Overlord of Vulcan.

609
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:37,027
克罗诺斯征服者 安多利女王
Dominus of Qo'noS, Regina Andor,

610
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:40,365
菲利帕·乔久·奥古斯都·伊波尼亚斯·塞塔瑞斯
Philippa Georgiou Augustus Iaponius Centarius.

611
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:41,927
酷
Cool.

612
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:42,977
配薯条的吗
That come with fries?

613
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:45,429
很好笑 对吧
That was good, right?

614
00:42:48,077 --> 00:42:48,902
好吧
Okay.

615
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:51,410
每次你不直接回答她的问题
Every time you don't answer her questions directly,

616
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:54,547
女皇陛下就会狠狠地打你的脸
Her Majesty will punch you in your face.

617
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:55,502
好吧
Fine.

618
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:58,777
我是达达
I'm Dada.

619
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:01,077
达达·诺伊 先念达达 再是诺伊
Dada Noe. Just Dada, then Noe.

620
00:43:01,077 --> 00:43:02,227
就是这样 没有中间
That's it. No in-betweens.

621
00:43:02,552 --> 00:43:04,389
然后 我
And I, uh...

622
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:08,794
我以前在瓦特殖民地开过一家病理学实验室
I used to run a pathology lab in the Watt Colonies.

623
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:16,068
搞什么鬼
What the shit, man?!

624
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:19,305
你明明说揍我脸的会是她
You said that she was gonna be doing the face punching!

625
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:22,708
现在我俩都说谎了 你不是那个达达
So now we both have lied. You are not that Dada.

626
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:26,145
你是那些人口中说的他的镜像版本
You're what these people call his Mirror.

627
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:30,627
你来自人族帝国
You came here from the Terran Empire,

628
00:43:30,627 --> 00:43:32,977
而且还带来了天赐之物
and you brought the Godsend.

629
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,487
什么天赐之物
What's the Godsend?

630
00:43:35,888 --> 00:43:38,527
我自己的军事委员会曾想要废黜我
My own war council tried to depose me.

631
00:43:38,527 --> 00:43:41,527
你知道我是怎么说服元帅开口的吗
Do you know how I convinced the field marshal to talk?

632
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,704
我曾是个管理员
I was an administrator

633
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:53,727
在帝国里的武器设施工作
at an Imperial weapons facility on Terra.

634
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:55,277
没错
Uh, yeah.

635
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:58,511
天赐之物被存放在我管理的设施中
The Godsend was stored at my facility.

636
00:43:59,877 --> 00:44:01,977
大多数人认为这只是一个传说
Most thought it was a legend,

637
00:44:01,977 --> 00:44:03,827
但我知道这是真的
but I knew it was real.

638
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:05,302
所以你想卖掉它
So you tried to sell it.

639
00:44:05,302 --> 00:44:06,451
是 是的
Yeah, yeah.

640
00:44:06,452 --> 00:44:10,190
我想靠得来的收益安静地生活在这里
I wanted to live here quietly on its proceeds.

641
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,857
你是怎么来到我们的宇宙的
How did you get to our universe?

642
00:44:16,162 --> 00:44:17,930
当时发生了一场离子风暴
There was an ion storm.

643
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,552
实际上是两场
Two of them, actually.

644
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:22,827
它们像对好了表一样准时相遇
And when they converged, which they do like clockwork,

645
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:26,027
撕裂了帝国边界某处的时空
they ripped something open on the fringes of the Empire--

646
00:44:26,027 --> 00:44:27,827
他们称之为异象
an anomaly, they called it--

647
00:44:27,827 --> 00:44:30,652
但这实际上是一条通道
but it was a passageway

648
00:44:30,652 --> 00:44:33,413
从人族帝国通往这里
to get to this place from the Terran Empire.

649
00:44:34,902 --> 00:44:38,827
从你们宇宙的新月星云穿出
Comes out through your Crescent Nebula.

650
00:44:38,827 --> 00:44:41,177
至少目前还是鲜有人知的
Few know about it. For now.

651
00:44:41,177 --> 00:44:43,756
但它四小时后会重新开放
But it'll open again in four hours.

652
00:44:43,756 --> 00:44:46,302
那本来是我要去见买家的时间
That's when I was supposed to be meeting my buyer.

653
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,777
你知道那武器的威力吗
Are you aware of what that weapon does?

654
00:44:48,777 --> 00:44:51,127
人族帝国已经耗尽了所有资源
The Terran Empire's burned through its resources.

655
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:52,602
饥荒肆虐 饿殍遍地
There's famine.

656
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:55,102
整个生态系统正在崩溃
Entire ecologies are collapsing.

657
00:44:55,102 --> 00:44:57,202
它们需要寻找新的领土
They need to find a new territory

658
00:44:57,203 --> 00:44:59,327
进行征服和压榨
to conquer and strip-mine.

659
00:44:59,327 --> 00:45:01,506
当他们意识到他们的超级武器不见了
When they realize that their superweapon is gone,

660
00:45:01,507 --> 00:45:03,552
他们一定会找到那条通道
they're gonna find that passageway--

661
00:45:03,552 --> 00:45:05,252
你知道他们会的 然后来到这里
you know they will-- and they'll come

662
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:08,581
烧杀抢掠每一寸领土 再奴役余生
and they'll burn everything they touch and enslave the rest,

663
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:12,202
您的帝国向来如此 陛下
because that's what the Empire does, Majesty.

664
00:45:13,102 --> 00:45:14,902
他们学您学到了精髓
They learned well from you.

665
00:45:17,152 --> 00:45:18,723
还有谁想要它？
Who else wants it?

666
00:45:18,724 --> 00:45:21,202
我真的不知道
I-I don't know, man.

667
00:45:21,202 --> 00:45:23,502
我收到了一个报价 钱是真的
I got an offer. The money was real.

668
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:25,802
有人偷走了我们的天赐之物
Someone stole the Godsend from us.

669
00:45:25,802 --> 00:45:26,777
究竟是谁
Who was he?

670
00:45:26,777 --> 00:45:27,927
我真不清楚
No idea.

671
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:31,452
无论是谁闯入我的套间 偷走了那件武器
Whoever broke into my room, whoever stole that weapon,

672
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:32,452
知道这些事的人
they know what they know 

673
00:45:32,452 --> 00:45:34,227
肯定是从你们其中之一得来的
because they learned it from one of you.

674
00:45:53,893 --> 00:45:56,729
紧急传送
Emergency transporter.

675
00:46:31,531 --> 00:46:32,477
这下好了
Well, this is great.

676
00:46:33,677 --> 00:46:35,427
更棒了
Oh, even better.

677
00:46:35,427 --> 00:46:37,452
那是我们的船吗 船炸了吗
Is that... is that the ship? Is the ship gone?

678
00:46:37,452 --> 00:46:38,752
我还挺喜欢那艘船的
I liked that ship.

679
00:46:38,752 --> 00:46:39,952
什么情况
What happened?

680
00:46:40,627 --> 00:46:42,208
有人搞破坏
Sabotage.

681
00:46:45,577 --> 00:46:46,811
什么
What?

682
00:46:46,812 --> 00:46:49,382
偷走天赐之物的人有一个同伙
Whoever stole the Godsend had a partner.

683
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:51,252
就在我们几个之中
It was someone here.

684
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:55,902
这意味着我们中的一个是内鬼
Which means one of us is a mole.

685
00:47:02,527 --> 00:47:03,327
可能是你
Could be you.

686
00:47:03,327 --> 00:47:04,227
原话奉还
Could be you.

687
00:47:04,877 --> 00:47:08,102
要是我的话 我早把你们都杀了
If it were me, I would have murdered all of you already.

688
00:47:08,102 --> 00:47:09,827
大哥 你是了解我的
Look, boss, if there's a mole,

689
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,627
绝对不可能是我
you know it's not me.

690
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:13,002
虽然这话听起来也就很像内奸说的 我也不确定
I mean, that sounds pretty moley to me. I don't know.

691
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:15,377
我们合作过差不多十次了
We've been on like ten ops together.

692
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:17,627
是没错 但我连你长什么样都不知道
Yeah, and I still don't even know what you look like, do I?

693
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,212
没人知道查莫人长什么样子
No one knows what a Chameloid looks like.

694
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:21,027
你可以变成任何你想变的样子
You might change into anything you want.

695
00:47:21,027 --> 00:47:22,182
那法兹呢
What about Fuzz, huh?

696
00:47:22,182 --> 00:47:24,127
他的体型与其他人都不在一个尺度上
He exists on a whole other scale than anybody else.

697
00:47:24,127 --> 00:47:24,852
转移话题是吗
Mm, deflecting?

698
00:47:24,852 --> 00:47:28,127
我的妻子即将产下我们的第一窝卵囊
My wife is about to lay our first litter of egg sacs.

699
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:31,552
而且我还有19万只幼崽正在路上
No, I have 190,000 hatchlings on the way...

700
00:47:31,552 --> 00:47:32,827
- 我希望他们活下去  - 那你听着
- and I want them to live.  - Well, look,

701
00:47:32,827 --> 00:47:34,352
你可以在我们中的任何人找到动机
you could find a motive for any of us.

702
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,652
也可能是你们中任何两个的组合
Or it could be a combination of any of you.

703
00:47:36,652 --> 00:47:38,527
你看 就像泽弗和法兹或者其他
You know, like-like Zeph and-and Fuzz or...

704
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:40,827
你还漏掉了梅尔
You are spinning out without Melle.

705
00:47:40,827 --> 00:47:42,127
你根本没法做出判断
You cannot land on a choice.

706
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:43,627
也许是你想给我灌输这个观点
Maybe you're putting that in my head

707
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:44,477
因为你才是内鬼
because you're the mole.

708
00:47:44,477 --> 00:47:45,977
又会不会是加勒特 她可是新来的
Huh? How about Garrett? She's new.

709
00:47:45,977 --> 00:47:47,152
她才不在乎我们
She doesn't care about us.

710
00:47:47,652 --> 00:47:48,652
我可是星际舰队的军官
I'm Starfleet.

711
00:47:49,802 --> 00:47:52,677
还有没有人像我一样感受到一阵英雄主义的风
Anyone else feel that heroic breeze right there

712
00:47:52,677 --> 00:47:53,579
弄乱了她的斗篷?
ruffling her cape?

713
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,152
听我讲 那边有一艘旧船
Okay, there's an old ship out there,

714
00:47:56,152 --> 00:47:57,352
一艘旧垃圾驳船
an old garbage scow.

715
00:47:57,352 --> 00:47:58,918
我发现它的时候你们还在
Yeah, I found it when you were up there

716
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,519
审问那个金属脑袋
interrogating metal head.

717
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:02,852
肯定已经很多年没人驾驶过它了
Must be years since anyone flew it,

718
00:48:02,852 --> 00:48:03,714
但我认为我们可以修复它
but I think we can work with it

719
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:06,192
开着它去追捕拿走天赐之物的人
to go after whoever took the Godsend.

720
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:08,560
我没那么讨厌你了
I dislike you less.

721
00:48:10,062 --> 00:48:11,852
如果我想有人喜欢我 我就会养一只狗
If I wanted someone to like me, I'd get a dog.

722
00:48:12,469 --> 00:48:13,602
我喜欢秩序
I like order.

723
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:15,301
我喜欢预测和结论
I like prediction and conclusion.

724
00:48:15,677 --> 00:48:17,027
那你可来错队伍了
Then you're on the wrong team

725
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,377
因为我们这还没揪出内鬼
because we've got mole,

726
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:21,807
被困在一颗荒无人烟的星球
stranded on a dead planet,

727
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:23,509
无法联络外界
no communication with the outside,

728
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:27,413
而且不到四个小时之后人族将得到天赐之物
and less than four hours before the Terrans get the Godsend

729
00:48:27,413 --> 00:48:29,282
并在银河系的任意一处使用它
and use it anywhere in the galaxy.

730
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:31,177
说起来
Speaking of which,

731
00:48:31,177 --> 00:48:33,352
小夸 天线阵列怎么样了
Quas, what about the antenna array?

732
00:48:33,352 --> 00:48:36,452
这个嘛
Uh, well...

733
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:39,425
这玩意已经过时几十年了
Well, it's a couple decades out of date.

734
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:42,561
我们修复它 把目前的情况告知31区
We get it up and running, then we tell 31 what's coming.

735
00:48:42,562 --> 00:48:43,829
我们齐心协力
We work together.

736
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:45,777
每个人都不要离开彼此的视线
Everyone stays in sight.

737
00:48:45,777 --> 00:48:46,317
好
Yeah.

738
00:48:46,877 --> 00:48:47,477
我盯着呢
Just...

739
00:48:52,456 --> 00:48:53,506
干活吧
Let's go.

740
00:49:07,997 --> 00:49:09,932
修好怕是没那么简单了
Well, there goes that idea.

741
00:49:10,856 --> 00:49:13,192
我们的小内鬼真的很忙
Our little mole has been really busy.

742
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:15,057
扯断了所有线路
Ripped up all the wiring.

743
00:49:15,057 --> 00:49:15,816
分两个队 我会带一个进入树林
Two teams. I'll lead one into the woods.

744
00:49:15,816 --> 00:49:17,117
我带三个人进树林
I'll lead one into the woods.

745
00:49:17,117 --> 00:49:19,597
试试看能不能修好那艘小艇
Three to see if we can salvage that scow.

746
00:49:19,597 --> 00:49:20,737
你和其他人一起留在这里
You stay here with the others

747
00:49:20,737 --> 00:49:22,257
并尝试修复天线阵列
and try and fix the antenna array.

748
00:49:22,257 --> 00:49:23,857
怎么轮到她来发号施令了
Why is she giving us orders now?

749
00:49:24,497 --> 00:49:25,757
因为是我让的
Because I'm letting her

750
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:27,077
而且她十有八九不是内奸
and I'm pretty certain she's not the mole.

751
00:49:27,782 --> 00:49:29,416
你可不会把赌注押在「十有八九」的身上吧
You wouldn't bet on a horse named Pretty Certain.

752
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:33,416
小夸、法兹 你们马上和乔久一起去船
Quas, Fuzz, you get to the scow right away with Georgiou.

753
00:49:33,416 --> 00:49:35,037
泽弗和加勒特 你们跟我待在这
Zeph and Garrett, you stay here with me.

754
00:49:35,037 --> 00:49:36,482
我们会搞定天线阵列的
We'll take care of the antenna array.

755
00:49:36,997 --> 00:49:38,484
请解释一下
Uh, I'm sorry.

756
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:40,216
我是应该出去
I'm supposed to go out into the woods

757
00:49:40,216 --> 00:49:42,056
和两个想杀我的人一起进入树林吗
with two people who want to kill me?

758
00:49:42,056 --> 00:49:44,117
保持在彼此的视线之内 别死了就行
Just stay in sight of each other and don't get dead.

759
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:44,936
好吗
Okay?

760
00:49:45,597 --> 00:49:47,037
真是多谢了 头儿
Yep, thanks, Cap.

761
00:49:47,037 --> 00:49:49,537
我得说 50%的几率他们中的一个想杀我
I mean, just fifty-fifty shot one of them wants to kill me,

762
00:49:49,537 --> 00:49:50,177
还有25%的几率
and then 25%...

763
00:49:50,177 --> 00:49:51,857
别贫嘴了小夸 快出发
Quas, just get your ass out there.

764
00:49:51,857 --> 00:49:52,637
我也爱你 头儿
I love you, too, Cap.

765
00:49:52,637 --> 00:49:53,176
行了行了
All righty.

766
00:49:53,176 --> 00:49:53,715
遵命
Aye, aye.

767
00:50:05,537 --> 00:50:07,537
这艘旧船上的内部电路
The internal circuitry on this old scow

768
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:08,977
状态还不错
is still in decent shape.

769
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:14,920
我看这些应该都还能用
Everything I'm seeing should work.

770
00:50:17,156 --> 00:50:19,877
所以我们正在追的东西 天赐之物
So this thing we're chasing, the Godsend,

771
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:23,477
你的工程师 他们安装保险没有?
your engineers, did they install a fail-safe?

772
00:50:23,477 --> 00:50:25,398
可以远程解除它吗
Can we disable it remotely?

773
00:50:27,677 --> 00:50:29,157
没有这种保险
There is no fail-safe.

774
00:50:29,157 --> 00:50:30,770
我不会允许的
I wouldn't allow it.

775
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:33,237
不愧是你
How very on-brand for you.

776
00:50:33,237 --> 00:50:34,536
可以再问你一个问题吗
Can I ask you one more question?

777
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:36,542
真的最后一个问题了
I'm just gonna ask you one more question.

778
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:39,457
既然你主导了天赐之物的制造
So you brought the Godsend into the world

779
00:50:39,457 --> 00:50:42,597
目的就是抹杀万亿条生命
to vaporize quadrillions of lives.

780
00:50:42,597 --> 00:50:44,337
就从没想过这有点
Never thought that was a little,

781
00:50:44,337 --> 00:50:46,077
太心狠手辣了吗
you know, much?

782
00:50:49,037 --> 00:50:51,457
我早已下令销毁它
I ordered it destroyed.

783
00:50:51,457 --> 00:50:52,977
但有人把它藏起来了
And someone hid it.

784
00:50:52,977 --> 00:50:54,497
你自己的人背叛了你
Your own people betrayed you.

785
00:50:55,477 --> 00:50:57,797
反正 你们的企业文化都烂到到不可救药了
Well, your corporate culture was straight-up shit.

786
00:50:57,797 --> 00:50:59,957
而且你还是没回答我的问题
And you didn't answer my question.

787
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,134
渐进线圈不见了
The asymptote coil is gone.

788
00:51:03,736 --> 00:51:06,616
肯定是有人为了铽元素把它拆走了
Someone must have scavenged it for the terbium.

789
00:51:06,616 --> 00:51:09,077
那再找一个 这个东西应该能飞
Well, find another one, this thing should fly.

790
00:51:09,697 --> 00:51:10,917
也许货舱就有
Maybe the cargo hull.

791
00:51:11,497 --> 00:51:12,717
别去
Huh. Oh, no, no.

792
00:51:12,717 --> 00:51:14,696
每个人都待在一起 好吗
Everyone stays together, all right?

793
00:51:15,176 --> 00:51:17,550
降低你杀死我们的可能性
Limits the possibilities of you killing us.

794
00:51:20,117 --> 00:51:21,386
我们去货舱吧
Let's go to the cargo hold, please.

795
00:51:21,387 --> 00:51:23,188
你不来吗
Aren't you coming?

796
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:26,158
当然 我可太高兴了
Yes. I couldn't be more excited.

797
00:51:29,517 --> 00:51:31,531
当然 我可以下去帮你
Yeah, I could help you down there, of course,

798
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:33,799
但考虑到 控制我们的行动
but considering how, you know, control

799
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,056
是你整个身份的核心
is central to your entire identity

800
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:37,803
而我本来就不太能接受这种事
and the fact that I'm just not good at it,

801
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:39,957
所以我就站在这里 
I'm just gonna stand here 

802
00:51:39,957 --> 00:51:42,741
- 为了我们的关系 什么也不做了 - 那你还真热心呢
- and honor our relationship by doing absolutely nothing. - Helpful.

803
00:51:42,742 --> 00:51:44,443
这叫做彻底的自我接纳
It's called radical self-acceptance.

804
00:51:44,757 --> 00:51:46,237
- 那你真是进步了 - 谢谢夸奖
- Evolved of you. - Well, thank you.

805
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:47,513
所以说 你能修好它吗？
So, can you fix it?

806
00:51:48,037 --> 00:51:49,997
我甚至不确定它是否坏了
I'm not even sure it's broken.

807
00:51:49,997 --> 00:51:51,584
它只是缺了个零件
It's just missing a part.

808
00:51:51,877 --> 00:51:53,785
看这里 这些被乱扯的线路看着很严重
Look, this-this torn wiring looks dramatic,

809
00:51:53,786 --> 00:51:56,077
但这设备本身就有冗余设计
but this equipment has redundancy built in.

810
00:51:56,077 --> 00:51:57,277
有一个简单的解决办法
There's an easy work-around.

811
00:51:57,277 --> 00:52:00,792
唯一问题是 有人取出了θ节点
Except somebody ripped out the theta junction.

812
00:52:00,793 --> 00:52:03,037
除此之外 这个东西应该可以用
Other than that, this thing should work.

813
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,665
好吧 也许我们的内鬼拿走了它
Okay, well, maybe our mole has it.

814
00:52:10,536 --> 00:52:11,677
加勒特?
Garrett?

815
00:52:11,677 --> 00:52:12,557
咋了
Yeah.

816
00:52:13,157 --> 00:52:14,257
泽弗
Zeph.

817
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:15,457
泽弗去哪了
Where is Zeph?

818
00:52:23,549 --> 00:52:25,217
泽弗 收到请回复
Zeph, come in.

819
00:52:26,452 --> 00:52:28,688
泽弗 你能听到吗
Zeph, do you copy?

820
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:37,377
泽弗
Zeph.

821
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,139
加勒特 是你做的吗
Garrett, was that you?

822
00:52:51,157 --> 00:52:52,778
加勒特 刚刚那是什么情况
Garrett, what the hell was that?

823
00:52:52,778 --> 00:52:54,536
有人刚激活了天线阵列
Someone just activated the antenna array.

824
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:56,897
该死
Damn it.

825
00:52:56,897 --> 00:52:57,877
具体情况如何
What's happening?

826
00:52:59,457 --> 00:53:01,196
加勒特 情况简报
Garrett, sitrep.

827
00:53:02,257 --> 00:53:03,989
越来越棒了
This is going to be good.

828
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:06,859
上尉 收到请回复 完毕
Lieutenant, do you copy? Over.

829
00:53:15,557 --> 00:53:16,296
安全
Clear.

830
00:53:17,457 --> 00:53:18,197
安全
Clear.

831
00:53:18,897 --> 00:53:20,171
这里什么都没有
Nothing here.

832
00:53:20,172 --> 00:53:22,497
怎么会有人用这个来发出信号呢
How could someone have used this to send out a signal?

833
00:53:22,977 --> 00:53:25,157
不可能 它少了一个部件
Impossible. It's missing a part.

834
00:53:25,677 --> 00:53:27,576
有人把它打成了筛子
And someone shot it to hell.

835
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:28,637
我听到有人在跑
I heard someone running.

836
00:53:29,277 --> 00:53:31,176
泽弗一定是把θ节点放回去了
Zeph must have put the theta junction back in.

837
00:53:31,496 --> 00:53:33,237
使用完毕后 射击毁掉了阵列
Then shot it after he used the array.

838
00:53:37,016 --> 00:53:39,457
所以他肯定是在擅离职守后绕回来的
So he must have circled back after he went AWOL.

839
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:42,977
泽弗来这个星球来阻碍我们
Zeph came down to this planet to sabotage us.

840
00:53:44,129 --> 00:53:45,898
现在我们被困住了
And now that we're stranded,

841
00:53:45,898 --> 00:53:48,776
他用阵列给同谋发了信息
he sent a message to whoever he's working with.

842
00:53:48,776 --> 00:53:50,435
他会潜伏直到撤离的船抵达
And he'll lay low until his ride gets here,

843
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,517
然后溜之大吉
and then he's long gone.

844
00:53:52,517 --> 00:53:54,197
那我们得先找到他
Then we need to find him first.

845
00:54:03,137 --> 00:54:04,737
观察者 能收到吗
Observer, do you copy?

846
00:54:04,737 --> 00:54:07,085
拜托 突袭者一号 我什么时候收不到了
Please, Raider One, when do I not copy?

847
00:54:07,086 --> 00:54:09,288
真好笑 情况如何
That's funny. Status?

848
00:54:11,677 --> 00:54:12,891
我检测到了不少干扰
I'm picking up a lot of interference,

849
00:54:12,892 --> 00:54:14,817
但三录仪显示 泽弗的生命信号
but the tricorder shows Zeph's biosignature

850
00:54:14,817 --> 00:54:16,996
就在这个区域 完毕
was just in this sector. Over.

851
00:54:17,897 --> 00:54:21,000
收到 保持低调 保持队形
Copy. Stay low and tight, people.

852
00:54:25,037 --> 00:54:27,077
你曾效力的那个军阀 吉里
The warlord you served, Giri,

853
00:54:27,077 --> 00:54:28,017
她后来怎样了
what happened to her?

854
00:54:28,784 --> 00:54:30,257
她死了 死于生前最爱的事
She died like she lived.

855
00:54:30,257 --> 00:54:32,144
你知道我说的什么
By that, you know what I mean.

856
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:33,917
她很幸运
She was lucky.

857
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:35,757
没染上良心这种东西
She wasn't infected with a conscience.

858
00:54:35,757 --> 00:54:36,657
染上?
Infected?

859
00:54:36,657 --> 00:54:37,237
是啊
Yeah.

860
00:54:37,237 --> 00:54:39,477
怪物就只能是个怪物
A monster can only be a monster.

861
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:42,657
一个会悔恨的怪物是没用的
A monster with regrets is useless.

862
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:44,657
嗯 所以这就是你
Mm. So that's why you were hiding

863
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,197
躲在那个偏远酒吧的原因
in a bar at the ass end of nowhere.

864
00:54:46,197 --> 00:54:48,797
也许这就是你和31区的人合作的原因
Maybe it's why you're working with 31.

865
00:54:48,797 --> 00:54:50,277
把自己的前科抹干净
To wipe your slate clean.

866
00:54:50,277 --> 00:54:53,037
像我们这样的人总是要付出代价的
There's always a price to pay for people like us.

867
00:54:53,037 --> 00:54:54,600
如果你不同意 你就不会在这里
You wouldn't be here if you didn't agree.

868
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,897
所以这就是你选择我的原因
Oh, so that's why you chose me.

869
00:54:56,897 --> 00:54:58,497
你认为我是一个有足够感情的怪物
You think I'm a monster who feels enough

870
00:54:58,497 --> 00:54:59,557
可以被控制
to be controlled

871
00:54:59,557 --> 00:55:01,416
也还能做那些脏活
but still do the real dirty work.

872
00:55:01,416 --> 00:55:03,297
不 我认为你想找回天赐之物 
No, I think you want the Godsend back 

873
00:55:03,297 --> 00:55:05,336
因为你知道这是你救赎自己的唯一机会
because you know it's your one chance to redeem yourself

874
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:06,376
为你所做的一切赎罪
for all the shit you've done.

875
00:55:07,016 --> 00:55:09,096
我想找回它 只因为它本就属于我
I want the Godsend back because it's mine.

876
00:55:16,797 --> 00:55:19,637
泽弗的外骨骼装甲正在渗漏
Ah. Zeph's exoskeleton is leaking.

877
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,496
漏液更多了
Yep, more.

878
00:55:32,957 --> 00:55:33,877
这边
This way.

879
00:56:05,857 --> 00:56:06,997
闪
Blip,

880
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:08,841
夹
Clip,

881
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:10,393
抓
Grip,

882
00:56:10,936 --> 00:56:12,117
脊灰
Polio,

883
00:56:12,117 --> 00:56:13,477
流感
Influensina,

884
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:14,957
牛痘
Cowpox...

885
00:56:14,957 --> 00:56:16,417
你在念什么呢
What are you saying?

886
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:18,477
我正在背诵我即将孵化的幼崽的名字
I'm reciting the names of me hatchlings.

887
00:56:19,496 --> 00:56:21,336
既然你们中的一个要谋杀我
Since one of you is going to murder me,

888
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,696
我应该是见不到他们了
I'm never gonna meet them,

889
00:56:22,696 --> 00:56:23,976
但至少我可以这样纪念他们
but at least I can honor them

890
00:56:24,656 --> 00:56:25,925
一个接一个
one by one.

891
00:56:26,197 --> 00:56:27,157
旅行
Trip,

892
00:56:27,697 --> 00:56:28,657
旅行二世
Trip 2,

893
00:56:29,336 --> 00:56:30,676
扁桃体炎
Tonsilyitis,

894
00:56:30,676 --> 00:56:32,016
克里米亚-刚果出血热
Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever...

895
00:56:32,797 --> 00:56:35,197
你要哭着念完19万孩子的名字吗
Are you gonna sob out 190,000 names?

896
00:56:35,197 --> 00:56:37,377
你怎么能这么冷漠 如此无情
How can you be so cold and insensitive?

897
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:39,016
他有可能记录下了发生的一切吗
Might he have recorded what happened?

898
00:56:39,016 --> 00:56:39,976
当然
Sure.

899
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:42,557
只是这段视频很可能和他一起被谋杀了
Except the footage was probably murdered along with him.

900
00:56:42,557 --> 00:56:45,197
我们可以将三录仪连接到外骨骼装甲上
We could connect one of the tricorders to his suit.

901
00:56:45,517 --> 00:56:46,776
就算没剩多少数据
Whatever data is left,

902
00:56:46,776 --> 00:56:48,177
凶手也昭然若揭了
we'll know who did this.

903
00:56:48,177 --> 00:56:50,997
说得好像我们都是嫌疑人一样
You say that like we're all suspects.

904
00:56:50,997 --> 00:56:52,696
并不是 好吗
We're not. All right?

905
00:56:52,696 --> 00:56:56,097
那时候我 法兹和乔久都在那艘船里
Fuzz, me and her were in the scow when all this happened--

906
00:56:56,097 --> 00:56:58,157
每个人都在彼此的视线范围内
everyone in sight of everyone else.

907
00:56:58,157 --> 00:57:00,692
没一个人乱跑 没错吧
And nobody went anywhere, right?

908
00:57:01,717 --> 00:57:02,808
对啊
Right.

909
00:57:05,557 --> 00:57:08,616
这不是泽弗的
Oh, this is not Zeph's.

910
00:57:09,557 --> 00:57:12,357
深褐色头发 25厘米
Brunette. 25 centimeters.

911
00:57:28,536 --> 00:57:29,621
这太疯狂了
This is insane.

912
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:30,817
别再坐立不安了
Stop fidgeting.

913
00:57:30,817 --> 00:57:32,917
我已经和泽弗近距离接触了一周了
I've been in close quarters with Zeph for a week.

914
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:34,696
行 所以你喜欢机甲什么的
Okay, so you're into mecha boom-boom.

915
00:57:34,696 --> 00:57:36,495
很多人类都是 不必害羞
Lots of humans are. No shame.

916
00:57:40,577 --> 00:57:41,816
<i>检测到血液</i>

917
00:57:43,496 --> 00:57:44,677
呃 那不可能啊
Well, that's impossible.

918
00:58:02,457 --> 00:58:04,056
加勒特上尉
Lieutenant Garrett,

919
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,379
<i>痕迹匹配</i>

920
00:58:04,056 --> 00:58:06,926
为什么你的指甲缝里会有泽弗的血
why is Zeph's blood underneath your fingernails?

921
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:13,557
加勒特上尉
Lieutenant Garrett,

922
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:16,897
在泽弗的尸体上发现了你的证据
evidence from you was found on Zeph's body,

923
00:58:16,897 --> 00:58:19,837
泽弗尸体上的证据也在你身上发现了
and evidence from Zeph's body was found on you.

924
00:58:20,517 --> 00:58:22,157
不像星际舰队的作风啊
Not very Starfleet.

925
00:58:22,157 --> 00:58:23,708
我问心无愧
Oh, I am very Starfleet.

926
00:58:24,337 --> 00:58:25,917
你清楚凶手并不是我
And you know I didn't do this.

927
00:58:26,997 --> 00:58:29,882
你只是害怕任何有道德准则的人
You are just terrified of anyone with a moral compass.

928
00:58:31,283 --> 00:58:35,120
但在那颗纯洁的小心灵的深处
And deep down in that pure little heart,

929
00:58:36,056 --> 00:58:38,817
你其实是个混乱小妖精 没错吧
you're actually a chaos goblin, aren't you?

930
00:58:38,817 --> 00:58:40,897
- 我知道你是这样的 小天使  - 别这么叫我
- I know you have it in you, angel. - Don't call me that.

931
00:58:40,897 --> 00:58:42,897
星际舰队发现了这样的你
Starfleet sniffed you out

932
00:58:42,897 --> 00:58:45,656
把你放在了最能发挥你作用的地方
and put you in a place where you'd be most useful.

933
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:48,597
31区正是为那些打破规则
Section 31 is just the place for officers 

934
00:58:48,597 --> 00:58:53,197
却又从未真正越界的军官准备的地方
who bend the rules, never quite break them until they do.

935
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:56,741
而你 正好适合这里
And you fit right in here.

936
00:59:02,097 --> 00:59:03,557
你想怎么折磨我都可以
You can torture me all you want.

937
00:59:03,557 --> 00:59:05,985
但我坚持自己没杀过人
You will never make me a murderer.

938
00:59:07,452 --> 00:59:08,497
住手
No.

939
00:59:23,336 --> 00:59:24,904
我们拿到录像了
We've got footage!

940
00:59:28,657 --> 00:59:29,457
住手
Stop!

941
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,110
快住手
Stop!

942
00:59:33,045 --> 00:59:34,616
这是我的装甲
This is my suit.

943
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:36,781
我即是装甲！
I am the suit!

944
00:59:37,883 --> 00:59:40,251
装甲就是我！
The suit is me!

945
00:59:40,252 --> 00:59:41,786
等一下
One second.

946
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,977
我们是你的朋友
We were your friends.

947
00:59:47,736 --> 00:59:48,997
曾是你的朋友
We were your friends.

948
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:51,729
你杀不了我
You can't kill me.

949
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:52,497
泽弗 别
Zeph, no.

950
00:59:52,497 --> 00:59:53,557
你不能
You can't kill...

951
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,357
泽弗是自杀的?
Zeph killed himself?

952
01:00:01,997 --> 01:00:03,108
他为什么要这么做
Why would he do that?

953
01:00:04,677 --> 01:00:07,997
抱歉让您失望了 陛下
Sorry to disappoint you, Your Majesty.

954
01:00:09,637 --> 01:00:11,736
这一切根本说不通
Look, none of this is making any sense.

955
01:00:11,736 --> 01:00:13,096
是啊 非常之不合理
No, none of it makes a lick of sense.

956
01:00:13,096 --> 01:00:14,536
他为什么要这样做呢
Why would he do this?

957
01:00:15,037 --> 01:00:16,257
给我几分钟时间
Give me a couple minutes to...

958
01:00:16,257 --> 01:00:17,197
我们没时间了
We don't have minutes.

959
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,158
那就几秒钟行了没
Well, then give me a couple seconds, then.

960
01:00:22,037 --> 01:00:22,917
可能是你
Could be you.

961
01:00:22,917 --> 01:00:23,697
原话奉还
Could be you.

962
01:00:23,697 --> 01:00:25,197
但我连你长什么样都不知道
And I still don't even know what you look like.

963
01:00:25,197 --> 01:00:27,157
你可以变成任何你想变的样子
You could change into anything you want.

964
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:28,696
她是新来的 她才不在乎我们
She's new. She doesn't care about us.

965
01:00:28,696 --> 01:00:29,637
我可是星际舰队的军官
I'm Starfleet.

966
01:00:30,337 --> 01:00:32,216
当你在说我这套装甲的时候
When you are talking about the suit,

967
01:00:32,725 --> 01:00:34,317
就是在说我
you're talking about Zeph.

968
01:00:34,317 --> 01:00:35,496
这可不是法兹
This isn't Fuzz.

969
01:00:35,496 --> 01:00:37,275
这个瓦肯外表不过是台机器
The Vulcan's just a machine, you know.

970
01:00:37,276 --> 01:00:38,809
我在里面呢
I'm inside.

971
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,477
这是身材羞辱
Scale-shamer!

972
01:00:40,477 --> 01:00:43,457
你绝对想不到我能进入多小的地方
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

973
01:00:43,457 --> 01:00:48,152
比如 身体改造组件的内部空间
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

974
01:00:48,153 --> 01:00:49,976
当时他启用了自动驾驶
There's an autopilot.

975
01:00:49,976 --> 01:00:52,257
这是唯一合理的解释
That's the only thing that makes sense.

976
01:00:54,077 --> 01:00:58,230
你给瓦肯机器设定了自动驾驶程序
You set the Vulcan machine on autopilot.

977
01:00:59,731 --> 01:01:03,467
所以当时它的反应才那么古怪
That's why its responses were so strange.

978
01:01:04,317 --> 01:01:05,237
你来不来
Aren't you coming?

979
01:01:05,697 --> 01:01:06,617
当然
Yes.

980
01:01:08,417 --> 01:01:11,475
你钻进了泽弗的外骨骼装甲
You flew into Zeph's exoskeleton.

981
01:01:12,117 --> 01:01:13,837
你钻进去之后
And once you were inside...

982
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,777
有人把西塔接口拆掉了
Somebody ripped out  the theta junction.

983
01:01:15,777 --> 01:01:17,237
加勒特 泽弗去哪了
Garrett, where's Zeph?

984
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,637
然后你控制了泽弗的装甲
Then you took control of Zeph's suit.

985
01:01:23,357 --> 01:01:25,637
当别人在找他的时候
While the others were out looking for him,

986
01:01:25,637 --> 01:01:27,858
你控制他溜回了通讯阵列
you made him sneak back into the antenna array

987
01:01:27,859 --> 01:01:29,496
然后发送了那些信息
and send those messages.

988
01:01:30,536 --> 01:01:32,296
不要这么做
Don't do this to them!

989
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,577
我们是你的朋友啊
We were your friends.

990
01:01:34,577 --> 01:01:37,368
然后你销毁了所有证据
Then you destroyed the evidence.

991
01:01:37,677 --> 01:01:38,903
还杀掉了泽弗
And you killed Zeph.

992
01:01:41,117 --> 01:01:43,037
然后你再把这一切嫁祸给加勒特
And then you planted the evidence on Garrett here.

993
01:01:48,022 --> 01:01:49,557
举起手来 法兹
Hands up, Fuzz.

994
01:01:49,557 --> 01:01:52,117
真是倒了血霉了
Oh, shite and ever shite.

995
01:01:59,457 --> 01:02:02,257
阿洛克 你不会真的要信她的鬼话吧
You're honestly gonna believe what she says, Alok?

996
01:02:02,257 --> 01:02:04,437
夸西 我们一起经历了这么多 你也信她的话吗
Quasi, after everything we've been through?

997
01:02:06,998 --> 01:02:09,668
我能先说一句吗
C-Can I just say one thing first?

998
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,541
泽弗的外骨骼我还控制着呢
I'm still hacked into Zeph's exoskeleton.

999
01:02:30,255 --> 01:02:31,256
喂
Come on!

1000
01:02:36,097 --> 01:02:38,330
说好的「不抛弃任何人」呢
What happened to "no crew member left behind"?

1001
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:57,357
快一点啊
Come on, come on!

1002
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:58,383
靠近他们
Get us closer.

1003
01:04:09,496 --> 01:04:11,557
接住你了
I got you. I got you.

1004
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:12,877
还好有我
Nice and easy.

1005
01:04:12,877 --> 01:04:13,736
该死
Damn.

1006
01:05:12,551 --> 01:05:15,197
你很关注黑市的动向 没错吧
You keep tabs on the black market, hmm?

1007
01:05:15,197 --> 01:05:16,997
你就是在那听说天赐之物的消息的
And that's where you heard about the Godsend.

1008
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,357
你在乎这些干什么
Why do you care?

1009
01:05:18,357 --> 01:05:20,124
家人你都下得去手
You killed your family.

1010
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,793
再多点人算什么呢
What's a few billion more people, huh?

1011
01:05:22,536 --> 01:05:25,016
天赐之物在哪 你的同谋是谁
Where is it? And who are you working with?

1012
01:05:25,016 --> 01:05:26,397
你登上了皇位
You took your crown

1013
01:05:26,397 --> 01:05:29,701
他们却痛苦地死在你的脚边
while they died in agony not ten feet away.

1014
01:05:30,797 --> 01:05:34,117
你奴役了你唯一的朋友
You condemned your only friend to slavery,

1015
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:37,441
居然还有脸在最后一刻给他一些怜悯?
and then you had the balls to offer him kindness at the end?

1016
01:05:39,717 --> 01:05:41,513
你怎么会知道的
How could you know that?

1017
01:05:41,997 --> 01:05:44,017
你终于发现了
Glad you're catching on.

1018
01:05:44,017 --> 01:05:46,285
他把你耍了 女皇陛下
He played you, Emperor.

1019
01:05:46,677 --> 01:05:48,320
桑还活着
San's alive.

1020
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:55,460
不可能
It's not possible.

1021
01:05:57,717 --> 01:05:59,016
绝对不可能 到底怎么回事
That's not possible. How?

1022
01:05:59,016 --> 01:06:01,833
他训练出了对毒药的抗药性
He built up an immunity from that poison, you know.

1023
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:05,003
每次只多服用很小的剂量
Teeny tiny doses over time.

1024
01:06:06,271 --> 01:06:10,056
看样子是小混蛋又赢了一次
Once again, small shite for the win, mama.

1025
01:06:11,016 --> 01:06:12,897
他在哪
Where is he?!

1026
01:06:13,297 --> 01:06:15,096
期待他的精彩表演吧
He's gonna put on quite the show.

1027
01:06:15,877 --> 01:06:17,656
你制造了天赐之物
You built the Godsend.

1028
01:06:17,656 --> 01:06:19,576
你制造了一个怪物
You made this monster.

1029
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:21,486
全是因为你
This is all you.

1030
01:07:05,496 --> 01:07:07,664
小心点可以吗
Be careful, all right?

1031
01:07:08,317 --> 01:07:10,317
我让你小心点
I said be careful.

1032
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:12,296
我还得用它活动呢
I have to get around in that.

1033
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,742
你都能买得起一百多具身体了 还在乎这一具
You can afford a hundred of them now.

1034
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:18,943
太好了
Oh, great.

1035
01:07:19,637 --> 01:07:21,597
这个能用不就行了
I'd settle for one that works.

1036
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:25,277
所以就是这个
So that's it?

1037
01:07:25,277 --> 01:07:26,797
无敌的天赐之物
The almighty Godsend.

1038
01:07:26,797 --> 01:07:28,277
等你做上皇帝了
When you're emperor,

1039
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:31,917
能不能给它换个没那么奇怪的名字
maybe start by naming it something less confusing.

1040
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,099
<i>离子风暴会聚倒计时</i>

1041
01:07:45,816 --> 01:07:47,405
跨越两个宇宙的通道打开时
Once that passageway opens up,

1042
01:07:47,406 --> 01:07:50,477
他会联系人族 他们会从中进入
he contacts the Terrans, they come through.

1043
01:07:53,037 --> 01:07:54,578
然后他们会在此引爆
They're detonating it here.

1044
01:07:55,157 --> 01:07:57,857
他就会成为帝国的新宠
And he'd be the darling of the Empire.

1045
01:07:57,857 --> 01:08:00,616
发生这样的灾难 星联就会陷入混乱
So he throws the Federation into chaos...

1046
01:08:00,616 --> 01:08:02,696
星际舰队自顾不暇
Starfleet will start scrambling.

1047
01:08:02,696 --> 01:08:04,255
入侵的完美时机
Perfect time to invade.

1048
01:08:07,537 --> 01:08:08,817
你创造了它
You gave birth to this thing.

1049
01:08:10,877 --> 01:08:12,317
我们要如何阻止
How do we stop it?

1050
01:08:12,317 --> 01:08:13,377
没办法
We don't.

1051
01:08:13,377 --> 01:08:15,816
我们被困在这 追不上他
We're trapped here, so we can't follow him.

1052
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:17,997
通讯天线坏了 我们也无法警告任何人
The antenna's destroyed, so we can't warn anybody.

1053
01:08:17,997 --> 01:08:19,303
胡扯
That is bullshit.

1054
01:08:20,817 --> 01:08:21,736
你肯定有更好的办法
You can do better than that.

1055
01:08:21,736 --> 01:08:22,507
我做不到
I can't.

1056
01:08:22,877 --> 01:08:23,937
天赐之物就像我自己
The Godsend is me.

1057
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:25,917
我唯一无法战胜的就是自己
I'm the only one I could never defeat.

1058
01:08:29,677 --> 01:08:31,650
过去总是缠着你不放
The past always catches up with you.

1059
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:33,096
不是吗
Right?

1060
01:08:37,377 --> 01:08:39,157
但并不意味着它总能赢
Doesn't mean it always wins.

1061
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:44,262
每个安全屋都有备用计划
Every safe house, I have a backup plan.

1062
01:08:44,262 --> 01:08:45,717
把那艘垃圾船修好
We'll get that scow running.

1063
01:08:46,157 --> 01:08:49,133
老大 那家伙飞不起来的
Boss, the scow won't fly.

1064
01:08:49,517 --> 01:08:50,977
没有渐进线圈就不可能
Not without an asymptote coil.

1065
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:54,573
我们有一个
We have one.

1066
01:08:54,573 --> 01:08:56,475
我们必须追上桑
We'll catch up with San.

1067
01:08:56,475 --> 01:08:58,017
我们要阻止他联系人族帝国
We'll make sure he can't contact the Terrans.

1068
01:08:59,157 --> 01:09:00,479
你早把线圈拆出来了
You ripped out the coil.

1069
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,847
有内奸在 我可没法什么都说出来
Couldn't tell you while a mole was still running around.

1070
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,686
你个混蛋
Asshole.

1071
01:09:20,298 --> 01:09:22,734
小夸 去帮她一下
Okay, Quas, give her a rip.

1072
01:09:28,557 --> 01:09:29,758
还是只有一下反应
Still just one pulse.

1073
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:36,815
来活了 朋友们
And we're in business.

1074
01:09:36,815 --> 01:09:40,497
我们只有不到三十分钟时间
Okay, team, we have less than 30 minutes.

1075
01:09:40,497 --> 01:09:42,437
小夸 设定航线前往新月星云
Quas, set a course for the Crescent Nebula.

1076
01:09:42,437 --> 01:09:45,037
路上将会非常颠簸
All right, this is gonna be bumpy and bad.

1077
01:09:45,037 --> 01:09:47,077
我推测桑的星舰会有武器
I'm assuming San's ship will be armed.

1078
01:09:47,077 --> 01:09:48,917
废话 人族帝国能有不武装的星舰吗
Yeah, every Terran ship's armed.

1079
01:09:49,357 --> 01:09:52,317
对方有质子加农炮 鱼雷
He'll have proton cannons, torpedoes,

1080
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:54,933
而我们只有一堆垃圾
and we are a garbage barge.

1081
01:09:55,697 --> 01:09:56,601
有啥好笑的
Why are you laughing?

1082
01:09:56,601 --> 01:09:58,737
因为我想不出来还有什么更糟的情况了
Because I can't imagine things getting much worse.

1083
01:10:04,837 --> 01:10:05,676
出发
Let's go.

1084
01:10:16,037 --> 01:10:18,355
所以 这艘船会在自身周围制造牵引力场
So, this thing flies around in the middle of a tractor field.

1085
01:10:18,356 --> 01:10:20,557
人们向太空里面扔垃圾
People jettison their garbage into space,

1086
01:10:20,557 --> 01:10:22,637
然后这种驳船会拖着垃圾和力场
and the scow flies around and drags the trash

1087
01:10:22,637 --> 01:10:23,657
一起飞行
along with the field.

1088
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:26,677
牵引力场里塞满垃圾之后
Once the tractor field is full,

1089
01:10:26,677 --> 01:10:28,497
就会一起把垃圾甩进星云里
it dumps the trash in the Nebula

1090
01:10:28,497 --> 01:10:30,277
让垃圾在辐射里自行分解
where it disintegrates in the radiation.

1091
01:10:31,277 --> 01:10:32,197
我就是想确认一下
I just want to be clear.

1092
01:10:32,197 --> 01:10:34,297
你是说我们最有可能用的上的武器
You're saying that our best potential weapon is

1093
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:35,897
是用来拖垃圾的牵引光束吗
a beam for collecting garbage?

1094
01:10:35,897 --> 01:10:36,697
没错
Yes.

1095
01:10:36,697 --> 01:10:37,297
那太棒了
Great.

1096
01:10:37,297 --> 01:10:39,844
提醒下 你在那指手画脚帮不上一点忙
Hey, being judgy never helped anything.

1097
01:10:41,997 --> 01:10:42,897
你要去哪
Where are you going?

1098
01:10:42,897 --> 01:10:43,797
轮机室
Engineering.

1099
01:10:43,817 --> 01:10:45,277
如果那是我们唯一的武器
If that's our only weapon,

1100
01:10:45,277 --> 01:10:47,477
我要把所有的能量都导入那里
I'll redirect all power to the tractor beams.

1101
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:49,287
这计划确实不错呢
That's actually a good plan.

1102
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:51,857
（加密传讯3）

1103
01:10:51,857 --> 01:10:56,757
（加密传讯3）
（跨越宇宙的通道）

1104
01:11:10,297 --> 01:11:11,157
我们就位了
We're in position.

1105
01:11:11,857 --> 01:11:13,357
通道很快就会打开
The passageway will open soon.

1106
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:16,580
你知道我在这一切结束后想干什么吗
Do you know what I want when this is all over?

1107
01:11:16,581 --> 01:11:18,877
这么大的一块空域
Just a big space, you know,

1108
01:11:18,877 --> 01:11:21,753
我要和我的小家伙们到处乱飞
for me hatchlings to tunnel and fly around and...

1109
01:11:23,397 --> 01:11:24,497
那你呢
What do you want?

1110
01:11:24,497 --> 01:11:27,791
我要菲利帕乔久永远沉沦于她的失败之中
I want Philippa Georgiou to marinate in her own defeat.

1111
01:11:28,577 --> 01:11:29,957
我明白你们之间是那种
I get you guys are all 

1112
01:11:29,957 --> 01:11:32,877
「永恒宿敌 性感的邪恶张力」之类的关系
"eternal nemesis, sexy evil tension" and stuff, but...

1113
01:11:33,297 --> 01:11:34,457
警报
Alert.

1114
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:35,667
有飞船靠近
Incoming vessel.

1115
01:11:36,457 --> 01:11:38,602
检测到碰撞航线
Collision trajectory detected.

1116
01:11:39,277 --> 01:11:40,872
她确实能把那玩意飞起来
Of course she got it off the ground.

1117
01:11:43,137 --> 01:11:45,275
我建议用鱼雷解决他们
I say we should use the torpedoes.

1118
01:11:49,497 --> 01:11:50,337
对方发现我们了
They've picked us up.

1119
01:11:50,957 --> 01:11:52,257
光子鱼雷来袭
Photon torpedo incoming.

1120
01:11:52,257 --> 01:11:53,437
击中倒计时
Impact in five, four...

1121
01:11:53,437 --> 01:11:55,357
是时候进行规避机动了吧
Really want to take evasive action right now!

1122
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:58,356
小夸 维持航线 护盾强度设置到最大
Quas, hold the course. Put everything in our shields.

1123
01:12:04,277 --> 01:12:05,937
她为什么不改变航线呢
Why isn't she changing course?

1124
01:12:05,937 --> 01:12:07,557
我看起来像是算命师吗
Do I look like a fortune teller?

1125
01:12:09,157 --> 01:12:11,937
我们有足够的能量使用牵引光束锁定他们吗
Do we have enough juice to drag them with the tractor beam yet?

1126
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:14,557
有 但我们没法再承受鱼雷的直接命中了
Yeah, but we can't take another direct hit.

1127
01:12:14,557 --> 01:12:17,497
鱼雷即将命中 五 四 三
Incoming torpedo in five, four...

1128
01:12:17,497 --> 01:12:20,378
先维持航线 我们马上就位了
Keep it steady. We're almost there...

1129
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:20,997
闪避
Now.

1130
01:12:31,857 --> 01:12:34,659
警告 导航控制功能失效
Alert. Navigation control suspended.

1131
01:12:34,659 --> 01:12:37,395
他们在干什么 想拽死我们吗
What are they gonna do, drag us to death?

1132
01:12:39,317 --> 01:12:42,217
她在阻止我和帝国取得联系
She's trying to stop me from reaching the Empire.

1133
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:48,777
怎么样 大家没事吧
How's everybody feeling about this?

1134
01:12:48,777 --> 01:12:49,637
这是唯一的办法了
It's the only way.

1135
01:12:49,637 --> 01:12:50,909
这办法有用
This can work.

1136
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:53,157
辐射会削减他们的护盾
The radiation will wear down their shields.

1137
01:12:53,157 --> 01:12:55,677
是啊 但是辐射也会影响我们
Yeah, the thing is, the radiation hits us, too.

1138
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,217
目标锁定系统失效
Target lock malfunction.

1139
01:13:00,837 --> 01:13:03,557
鱼雷无法锁定目标 加农炮也离线了
I can't get torpedo lock. Cannons offline.

1140
01:13:04,597 --> 01:13:05,786
桑?
San?

1141
01:13:06,557 --> 01:13:08,025
桑
San.

1142
01:13:08,026 --> 01:13:09,794
桑!
San!

1143
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,271
辐射已达致命水平
Radiation levels critical.

1144
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,797
护盾失效 重复 护盾失效了
Shields are down. I repeat, shields are down!

1145
01:13:27,077 --> 01:13:28,146
他的呢
And San's?

1146
01:13:28,146 --> 01:13:30,217
还剩12% 仍在迅速下降
His are at 12% and falling fast.

1147
01:13:30,217 --> 01:13:31,477
等离子辐射来袭
Plasma incoming!

1148
01:13:31,477 --> 01:13:32,717
如果我们被卷入这样的爆炸里
We get caught with a burst like that,

1149
01:13:32,717 --> 01:13:34,257
我们就完了
and we're done.

1150
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,420
这就是混乱 加勒特
This is chaos, Garrett.

1151
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,177
你喜欢混乱没错吧
You know you love it, hmm?

1152
01:13:38,837 --> 01:13:41,497
直面它 接纳它 享受混乱
Maybe let it in, make out with it a little.

1153
01:13:41,497 --> 01:13:43,177
这就是星际舰队派你到此的原因
It's why Starfleet put you here.

1154
01:13:44,197 --> 01:13:45,837
混乱就像是我的炮友
Chaos is my friend with benefits.

1155
01:13:46,117 --> 01:13:47,997
就是这样 越混乱越好
Yeah, Garrett, let's get messy.

1156
01:13:47,997 --> 01:13:48,677
怎么样
Hmm?

1157
01:13:49,437 --> 01:13:50,037
当然
Okay.

1158
01:13:50,037 --> 01:13:50,837
加油 小夸 你能行的
You got this, Quas.

1159
01:13:50,837 --> 01:13:51,637
没问题
Uh-huh.

1160
01:13:51,637 --> 01:13:52,904
准备好了吗
You ready?

1161
01:13:52,904 --> 01:13:54,338
桑的护盾只有4%了
San's shields are at four percent.

1162
01:13:56,337 --> 01:13:57,517
最后2%
Two now.

1163
01:13:58,337 --> 01:14:00,197
他的护盾已失效
His shields are down.

1164
01:14:00,197 --> 01:14:01,037
可以出发了
Good to go.

1165
01:14:39,784 --> 01:14:40,737
菲利帕
Philippa!

1166
01:14:46,797 --> 01:14:49,277
我们这次
This contest only ends

1167
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:52,330
不死不休
when one of us is dead!

1168
01:14:58,377 --> 01:15:01,471
引爆程序已启动
Detonation sequence activating.

1169
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,237
听好了 我们纳米人
See, the Nanokins,

1170
01:15:04,237 --> 01:15:05,517
不需要星际联邦
we don't need the Federation.

1171
01:15:05,517 --> 01:15:06,437
向来如此
We never have.

1172
01:15:06,437 --> 01:15:10,197
早在你们这些庞然大物发现我们之前我们就在统治了
We ruled before you behemoths found us,

1173
01:15:10,197 --> 01:15:12,583
在你们死后 我们会再次统治
and we will rule again after you're gone.

1174
01:15:20,317 --> 01:15:22,726
猜猜谁会在待会的大爆炸中存活下来
Guess who survives very large explosions.

1175
01:15:24,597 --> 01:15:26,617
是我们纳米人
Very small things.

1176
01:15:27,897 --> 01:15:29,257
好了 我先失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1177
01:15:29,257 --> 01:15:30,757
我得让船脱离牵引光束
I need to cut our ship loose.

1178
01:15:30,757 --> 01:15:32,777
如果你的朋友在这个过程里死了那真是抱歉
Sorry if your friends die in the process.

1179
01:15:32,777 --> 01:15:34,371
不 我在开玩笑
No, I'm joking.

1180
01:15:34,372 --> 01:15:35,857
我等不及要杀死他们了
I can't wait to kill them.

1181
01:15:35,857 --> 01:15:38,676
再见了 你个巨大狗屎
So long, you big lumps of shite!

1182
01:15:55,797 --> 01:15:56,737
谁在驾驶那艘飞船
Who's flying that?

1183
01:15:56,737 --> 01:16:00,597
根据传感器 上面有一个微型生命
Uh, according to the sensors, one tiny life-form on board,

1184
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:02,133
它在朝我们飞来
and it's heading right for us.

1185
01:16:05,697 --> 01:16:07,097
导弹锁定
Plot missile lock.

1186
01:16:07,097 --> 01:16:09,540
我们只有垃圾 明白吗 只有垃圾
We have trash, all right? Just trash.

1187
01:16:29,257 --> 01:16:30,517
但为一体
But one.

1188
01:16:30,737 --> 01:16:31,549
桑
San.

1189
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:42,206
等待确认生物签名
Awaiting biosignature confirmation.

1190
01:16:44,197 --> 01:16:45,137
我追踪到法兹的穿梭艇了
I've got Fuzz's shuttle.

1191
01:16:45,137 --> 01:16:46,577
他要回到桑的船上
He's heading back to San's ship.

1192
01:16:46,577 --> 01:16:47,777
我们只能勉强跟上
We're barely keeping up.

1193
01:16:48,377 --> 01:16:48,879
跟住他
Stay on him.

1194
01:16:48,879 --> 01:16:50,897
提醒下 我们没有任何武器
Uh, we don't have any weapons.

1195
01:16:50,897 --> 01:16:52,437
我们有一个满载垃圾的货舱
We have a payload bay full of trash.

1196
01:16:52,437 --> 01:16:53,737
不要跟丢那个穿梭艇
Do not lose that shuttle.

1197
01:16:53,737 --> 01:16:54,437
好吧
Okay.

1198
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:02,459
我曾经什么都不是
I was nothing!

1199
01:17:02,997 --> 01:17:05,295
那个男孩软弱无力
That boy was soft, weak.

1200
01:17:05,296 --> 01:17:09,367
但在你脚下服侍的这些年教出了现在的我
But all those years under your heel taught me who I am now.

1201
01:17:10,537 --> 01:17:12,503
帝国舰队将会穿过通道过来
The Empire's coming through that portal.

1202
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:13,877
我的帝国
My Empire!

1203
01:17:13,877 --> 01:17:16,177
我们将统治这个宇宙
And we will reign over this universe

1204
01:17:16,177 --> 01:17:19,357
用公正又仁慈的手段 不像你
with righteous mercy, not like you!

1205
01:17:19,877 --> 01:17:25,216
从来不会有仁慈的独裁者 桑
There are no benevolent dictators, San.

1206
01:17:30,617 --> 01:17:32,790
这是你教会我的
You taught me that.

1207
01:17:34,037 --> 01:17:36,094
我们还能回头
We can come back from this.

1208
01:17:40,337 --> 01:17:41,932
我们可以重新开始
We can start over.

1209
01:17:57,957 --> 01:17:59,417
我爱混乱
Oh, I love chaos.

1210
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:00,857
混乱是我的菜
Chaos is my jam.

1211
01:18:00,857 --> 01:18:02,377
我爱混乱
I love chaos.

1212
01:18:03,177 --> 01:18:05,677
加勒特 你在那里边干啥呢
Garrett, what the hell are you doing down there?

1213
01:18:05,677 --> 01:18:07,377
夸西 我是个训练有素的星际舰队军官
Quasi, I am a trained Starfleet officer

1214
01:18:07,377 --> 01:18:09,577
我也非常希望活得到能当上舰长的那一天
who fully intends on living long enough to be captain one day.

1215
01:18:09,577 --> 01:18:11,237
你得相信我 好吗
You got to trust me, okay?

1216
01:18:11,717 --> 01:18:13,477
你好呀
Hi there.

1217
01:18:13,477 --> 01:18:15,337
真高兴你找到了我
I'm so glad you found me.

1218
01:18:15,337 --> 01:18:16,300
你刚刚说啥了
What'd you just say?

1219
01:18:19,617 --> 01:18:20,697
是玩具说的
It's a toy.

1220
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:22,737
看起来它来自一个德鲁姆行星
Looks like it came from a Droom planet.

1221
01:18:22,737 --> 01:18:24,874
来一起找点乐子怎么样
Shall we do something fun together?

1222
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:29,339
你还好吗 星际舰队女士
You okay down there, Starfleet?

1223
01:18:33,017 --> 01:18:35,657
哦 拜托 拜托 拜托 太好了
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yes.

1224
01:18:35,657 --> 01:18:38,317
我们不允许德鲁姆科技进入联邦
Oh, we do not let Droom tech into the Federation

1225
01:18:38,317 --> 01:18:40,858
因为他们用特瑞金作为电源
because they use Terrenium as a power source.

1226
01:18:41,857 --> 01:18:43,417
你是准备炸飞我们吗
Oh, you're gonna blow us up, aren't you?

1227

你最好希望这艘船的船体

维持位置在法兹的飞船前
Stay in front of Fuzz's ship

1237

我能破译其中一些

1244
01:20:18,922 --> 01:20:20,358
我只需要把它分解成语素

然后 你知道

01:20:28,697 --> 01:20:29,937
反正怎样都是爆炸呗
We're gonna blow up anyway.
