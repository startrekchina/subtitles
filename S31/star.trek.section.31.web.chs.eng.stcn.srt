00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,020
还有那位瓦肯人
And we can't forget the Vulcan,

159
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,340
被舞台表演逗得哈哈大笑
laughing way too hard at the stage banter.

160
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,212
鉴于瓦肯人从来不笑
And since Vulcans never laugh,

161
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,612
他要么也是个白痴
he's either an idiot, too,

162
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:50,817
（* 瓦肯人每七年经历一次的发情时期）

163
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:50,817
要么就是在庞发*期间脑子变得不正常了
or lost his mind during pon farr and went insane.

164
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,754
拜托 那明明很好笑啊
Oh, come on. That was funny.

165
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,840
还有你安排给他那个特别正经的人类搭档
And the very serious human you stuck him with...

166
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,292
你控制一下自己
Reel it in anytime.

167
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,000
她看着就是一副苦大仇深的样子
...she's got a stick so far up her backside,

168
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
一开口就能听出来
it's coming out her mouth.

169
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,065
冷静一点
Just reel it in.

170
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,920
那位是
That would be

171
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,500
加勒特上尉*
Lieutenant Garrett.

172
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,500
（* 瑞秋·加勒特 未来进取号-C的舰长 见《下一代》3x15）

173
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,580
星际舰队的
Starfleet.

174
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,746
无趣到死
Where fun goes to die.

175
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:23,016
你找我花了不少时间啊
It took you long enough to find me.

176
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,380
只要你留在巴拉姆空间站
We knew that having you here on the Baraam

177
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,321
对我们来说 总有一天会派上用场
would be valuable to us one day.

178
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,420
好吧 我不得不说我一点儿也不感动
Well, I'm not feeling motivated to be valuable

179
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,894
我只为自己所用
to anyone but myself.

180
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:42,202
今夜请说愿意
♪ Say yes tonight ♪

181
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:45,660
一切都可应允
♪ Say yes to everything... ♪

182
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,008
所以 我们就这么开始谈判吗
So, is this where we start negotiating?

183
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,210
那要看情况了
Hmm, that depends.

184
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,380
你们是何时发现我的
How long have you known about me?

185
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,200
从你自前任站主那儿接手开始 我们就知道了
Ever since you took over from the previous owner,

186
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,950
而那位站主到现在依然下落不明
who we still haven't found.

187
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,120
其他的前站主也是
Well, all of.

188
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,360
这可不是我干的
That wasn't me.

189
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,421
乔久皇帝
Emperor Georgiou,

190
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,120
我完全有权逮捕你
I am authorized to arrest you

191
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
抹除你的记忆
and wipe your mind clean.

192
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,260
但是话又说回来 我心里还是觉得
But then again, there's a part of me

193
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,883
你更应当背负那些不堪回忆而活
that wants you to live with your memories.

194
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:12,265
尤其种族灭绝的那些
The genocidal ones.

195
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,203
你有权逮捕我
Being authorized to arrest me

196
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:20,180
不等于你有能力逮捕我
isn't the same as being able to arrest me.

197
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,260
你真的希望31区 希望我
You really want Section 31-- want me--

198
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,944
不止不休地追着你吗
dogging you until the end of time?

199
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:27,380
无聊
Boring.

200
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,817
往事如影随形啊
The past always catches up with you.

201
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:34,260
既然我们都不希望如此
And as much as both of us might hate it, 

202
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,340
我会帮你个忙
I'm doing you a favor.

203
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,100
最后一次任务
One last mission.

204
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,627
听着
Listen.

205
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,900
你相信命运吗
Do you believe in fate?

206
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,465
我信
Because I do.

207
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,667
你无处可逃
You can't hide from it.

208
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,070
乔久 你在这里什么都不是
You're nothing here, Georgiou.

209
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,277
现在我给你一个机会
I'm giving you a chance to get back in.

210
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:00,247
参与这场跨越银河的行动
In on the action on a galactic scale.

211
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,682
别再逃避了
Stop running from it.

212
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,053
成为你本该成为的人
Be who you are.

213
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,004
或者就在这个酒吧待一辈子
Or stay and tend bar for eternity.

214
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,579
那就抓紧开始吧
Let's get on with it.

215
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,782
菲莉帕·乔久 认识一下我的团队
Philippa Georgiou, meet my team.

216
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,517
这是梅尔
This is Melle.

217
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,440
泽弗
Zeph.

218
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,291
你看起来像一把瑞士军刀
You look like a Swiss Army knife.

219
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,294
等等
Uh, hold on.

220
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,861
我不知道那是什么意思
I don't know what that means, but I'm not gonna

221
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,096
但我不可能傻站在这里被你侮辱
just stand here and get insulted.

222
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,664
我没说你
I'm not talking about you.

223
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,533
我是说你的装甲
I'm talking about your suit.

224
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,636
鉴于你是新来的
Um, you're new,

225
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,705
所以我就解释这一回
so I'm gonna just explain this one time

226
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,880
当你在说我这套装甲的时候
that when you are talking about the suit,

227
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,975
就是在说我
you're talking about Zeph.

228
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,200
泽弗有点机械变形障碍症 大概
Zeph suffers from what we call mecha dysmorphia.

229
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,740
我也许不知道那是啥意思
And I may not know what that is,

230
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,520
但我也不接受你这说法
but I'm also not gonna take that from you, 

231
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,983
小夸 我觉得你冒犯了我
Quas, and personally I'm offended.

232
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,200
-我觉得你应当知道  -这挺对的
- I think you should know... - Well, it's accurate.

233
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,540
你不能诊断我得了什么 你不是医生
It's not a diagnosis. You're not a doctor.

234
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,054
泽弗 泽弗 泽弗
Zeph. Zeph, Zeph!

235
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,580
-他知道 他知道 别吵了 -好吧
- He knows. He knows. He knows. - Okay, fine.

236
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,557
他知道
He knows.

237
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,758
-他明白的 他明白的 -是的
- He gets it. He gets it. - Yes.

238
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,294
行了 那位瓦肯人呢
Okay, what about that Vulcan?

239
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,763
没人跟她说吗
Nobody told her?

240
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,271
你说这个吗 正跟你说话的这个东西
This? The thing you're talking to?

241
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:29,180
这个瓦肯外表不过是台机器
The Vulcan's just a machine.

242
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,003
我在里面
I'm inside.

243
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,039
操控它
Driving.

244
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:44,217
我通过体内的备用驾驶舱控制这具身体
I control the body from a backup vehicle.

245
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:47,018
这是我专门用来在狭窄空间里进出的小玩意
Yeah, something I use to get into tight spots.

246
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,187
你好啊
Hi there.

247
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,223
我是法兹
I'm Fuzz.

248
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,860
法兹是纳米人
Fuzz is a Nanokin.

249
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,580
一个天性爱玩的家伙
Real fun-loving guy.

250
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,100
你好
Hello.

251
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,420
除非他哪天不感兴趣了
Except for when he's not.

252
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,120
然后他就会变成一个易暴易怒的人了
Then he's deranged with an anger management problem.

253
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,135
你该说完第一句就闭嘴的 夸西
Well, you could've stopped at the first thing, Quasi.

254
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:06,680
一个非法制造的瓦肯型运输载体
A bootleg Vulcan conveyance?

255
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,640
你肯定在黑市上见过不少了不得的东西
You must see cool stuff on the black market.

256
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,240
纳米人都是天生的拾荒者
Nanokins are pretty scavengery.

257
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,700
31区在废弃的船只上发现了虫害 
31 made first contact when we 

258
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,660
然后才有了第一次接触
discovered an infestation on a derelict ship.

259
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,300
夸西
Quasi.

260
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
啊 糟了
Oh, shit.

261
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,760
夸西 你再说一遍「虫害」试试看
Say "infestation" one more time, Quasi.

262
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,740
叫我拾荒者 你这袋没形状的烟灰
Say "scavenger," you sack of amorphous soot!

263
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,440
我 我一顺口就说出来了
I-I s-- I heard it as soon as I said it.

264
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,560
我真想好好揍你一顿
I will kick your ass

265
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,840
直到你变成一团液体的…
until you cannot form a solid mass of...

266
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,760
法兹 情绪控制一下
Fuzz. Fuzz. Lock it down.

267
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,132
我已经够冷静了
I am locked down.

268
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,372
我被困在一个巨大的瓦肯机器脑袋里
I'm trapped inside a giant robot Vulcan head.

269
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,942
此刻没人比我更「冷静」了
No one is more locked down than me right now!

270
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,840
纳米人情绪光谱不太稳定
Nanokins have a wonky emotional spectrum.

271
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,200
不不不不行
No, no, no, no, no, no, 

272
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
不许用居高临下的态度对我 梅尔
I will not be condescended to, Melle,

273
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,449
尤其是你 因为说实话
particularly not by you, because honest...

274
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,820
我爱你 你就是一切
I love you. You are everything.

275
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:54,900
- 你喜欢我复杂的情绪光谱吗 - 法兹
- Does my spectrum work for you? - Fuzz.

276
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,823
- 我意思是 你是认真的吗 还是说…  -法兹
- I mean, like, like, are you into it or...  - Fuzz!

277
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:57,789
法兹
Fuzz!

278
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,292
她在侮辱你 老兄
She's insulting you, pal.

279
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,820
我就知道德尔塔人又会做他们德尔塔人的那一套
I know Deltans are gonna do their Deltan thing,

280
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,196
但是自尊自爱点吧 伙计
but have a little self-respect, would you?

281
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,363
能继续任务了吗
Can we continue?

282
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:07,140
然后这位是瑞秋·加勒特上尉
And that's Lieutenant Rachel Garrett.

283
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,400
她仅为这次任务被临时派往31区
She is detailed to Section 31 for this one mission only.

284
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,020
上尉 你得罪了谁才被派来这个秘密组织?
Who did you piss off to get stuck in black ops, Lieutenant?

285
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,840
派个星际舰队的人进来是确保我们行事合规
Starfleet is here to make sure we color inside the lines.

286
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,860
我参与本次行动的目的是保卫联邦
Starfleet is here to defend the Federation,

287
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,349
维持和平状态并确保不发生谋杀事件
keep the peace and make sure no one commits murder.

288
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,884
那你呢
And you?

289
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:25,380
等一下
One moment.

290
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,319
我认识夸西是因为
Quasi came on my radar

291
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,680
他证明了神经胶质细胞簇的存在
when he proved the existence of glioclusters.

292
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,759
神经胶质细胞簇只存在于理论中
Glioclusters are theoretical.

293
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,292
曾经是
Formerly theoretical.

294
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,063
生命充满无限可能
Life is just branching possibilities.

295
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,563
它们以你能想象的任何方式盛开
You know, they bloom and blossom any way you can imagine.

296
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:43,300
比如 我现在可能会被你吓倒
For example, I could be intimidated by you right now.

297
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,980
毕竟你杀了那么多人
I mean, after all, you've murdered so many people...

298
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,974
而且你好像能看透我的灵魂
and you seem to be staring right into my soul.

299
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,744
我可以对此做出回应
I could respond to that

300
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,960
或者我可以观察我的感受
or I could observe my feelings right now,

301
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,000
不管它 只做我需要做的事
lock it away and do what I need to do.

302
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,780
或者说
Or...

303
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,585
小夸 选一个好吗
Quas. Pick one. Hmm?

304
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:01,420
- 好吧 - 有时夸西看到了太多可能性
- Yes. - Sometimes Quasi sees so many options 

305
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,640
以至于他的思维可能会有所停滞
he gets brain-freeze.

306
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,480
多谢夸奖呢 梅尔
Thank you, Melle.

307
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,225
夸西 我们能继续了吗
Quasi, can we carry on, please?

308
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,560
我们的目标是达达·诺尔
Our target's name is Dada Noe.

309
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,996
一个有道德底线在哪都存疑的家伙
Dubious moral compass.

310
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,200
在他叛变之前 他在瓦特殖民地经营着一个病理学实验室
Ran a pathology lab on the Watt Colonies before he went rogue.

311
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,720
自那以后 他便开始替人定制生化武器
Since then, he's been designing bioweapons on spec.

312
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,340
诺尔前往巴拉姆空间站是为了
Noe's on his way to the Baraam 

313
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,760
把他的最新发明出手给米诺斯最高议会
to sell his latest creation to the Minosian High Council.

314
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,200
目前我们与米诺斯统治体之间并无正式敌对状态
There are no formal hostilities with the Minosian Sway,

315
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,240
但若他们拿到这件武器 
but that could change 

316
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,020
情况可能会发生变化
if they get their hands on a superweapon.

317
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,260
有任何关于这个超级生物武器的信息吗
Do we know what this bio superweapon is?

318
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,500
没有 但要是诺尔成功出售就坏了
No, but if Dada Noe is selling it, it's bad.

319
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,455
所以你的任务目标就是确保交易不会发生
So you're here to make sure the sale never happens.

320
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,931
怎么做
How?

321
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:41,123
你对我们行动的发觉确实造成了一些影响
Things went south when you spotted us,

322
00:22:41,123 --> 00:22:42,800
但计划仍然可靠
but the plan is still solid.

323
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,760
首先 阿洛克会
First, Alok was going to...

324
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,635
你说吧
You can say it.

325
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,380
和你亲密接触
Connect. With you.

326
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,240
欢迎
Welcome!

327
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,200
异想天开啊
What a cute idea.

328
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,180
一旦我们适当的分散了你的注意力
Once we had you suitably distracted,

329
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,285
就轮到夸西做他擅长的事了
Quasi would do the other thing Quasi does.

330
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,880
好了 夸西
Okay, Quasi.

331
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
麻烦你了
If you would do the honors.

332
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,260
没问题
Absolutely.

333
00:23:18,803 --> 00:23:20,299
我们开始吧
Let's get to work.

334
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,441
欢迎欢迎 达达·诺尔
Welcome, Dada Noe.

335
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,577
这时候法兹会参与进来
This is where Fuzz comes in.

336
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,818
你绝对想不到我能进入多小的地方
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

337
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:43,222
比如 身体改造组件的内部空间
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

338
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,858
只要我进入达达的身体改造组件里
Oh, once I fly inside Dada's body mod,

339
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,960
这就是我要发挥作用的时刻
well, then it's time to get to work.

340
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,600
这么多电路
So many circuits.

341
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,931
太多可能出错的东西了
So many things that could go wrong.

342
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,833
我们这位全副武装的十字军战士
Competency crusader here will talk me through

343
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,301
会通过植入物跟我交谈
the tech on the implant.

344
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,571
如果我认为我们通过达达·诺尔的植入物
And if I think we're putting Dada Noe's life in danger

345
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,280
让他生命垂危
by tinkering with that implant,

346
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,700
我会通过星际舰队
I will unleash the full weight of Starfleet

347
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,076
对此次任务施压
on this whole operation.

348
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:07,000
嘿 我们讨论的可是一个要出售超级武器的家伙
Oy, we're talking about a bloke who's selling superweapons

349
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,680
他会把东西卖给任何有拉蒂金卡的三流恐怖分子
to any third-rate terrorist with a Latinum card.

350
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,460
听仔细了 满脑子废品的家伙
Listen carefully, Junkyard.

351
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,480
星际舰队不执行暗杀任务
Starfleet does not do assassinations.

352
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,060
唉 别再满脑子的惦记着你的最高指导原则了
Ay, don't get your prime directives in a bunch.

353
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,220
不会让你亲自下场弄脏手的
You are not going to get your hands dirty

354
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,520
也不会坏了你升舰长的前程
and mess up your chances of becoming captain.

355
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,894
我可是顶尖科学官
I'm a top-tier science officer.

356
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:22,923
屁股拧成麻花了
Butt pretzel.

357
00:24:22,923 --> 00:24:24,240
就是个死板精
Tight-ass.

358
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,680
真是太不尊重人了
So disrespectful.

359
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,867
只要加勒特和法兹切断了组件的链接
Soon as Garrett and Fuzz sever that link...

360
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,180
他就随便我们拿捏了
...he'll be under our control, 

361
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,040
我会和泽弗一起制服他
and I'll take him down with the help of Zeph.

362
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,800
一下搞定
That's what I call a hit.

363
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,320
只需一下
One.

364
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,216
达达·诺尔会被拘留 他的病原体会被没收
Dada Noe and his pathogen will be in custody

365
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,054
这一切会在卖家出现在巴拉姆空间站之前就完成
before the buyers can even show up to the Baraam.

366
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,100
速战速决
And we are in and out.

367
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,360
呃
Mm.

368
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,900
算了
Meh.

369
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,294
啥
Meh?

370
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,540
我有个更简单的办法
I have a simpler idea.

371
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,600
表情很绝望 我看的出来
♪ Desperate, I can tell ♪

372
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,802
所有的祈求
♪ All that begging ♪

373
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,837
都像是为你量身定做的
♪ Suits you well. ♪

374
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,706
现在打爆我的手机
♪ Blowing up my phone now ♪

375
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,809
我向上 你低头
♪ Going up, you bow down ♪

376
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,377
看看是谁需要谁
♪ Look at who needs who... ♪

377
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:15,114
欢迎欢迎 达达·诺尔先生
Welcome, Monsieur Dada Noe.

378
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:18,420
您的到来使巴拉姆空间站蓬荜生辉
We're honored to have you here at the Baraam.

379
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,940
我是维罗妮卡·杜·弗朗克 这里的店主
I am Veronique du Franc, the proprietor.

380
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,920
我早就预约我的套间了吧
I told them to have my suite ready.

381
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,160
当然 先生
Mais oui, monsieur.

382
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,224
请允许我带您到房间里
May I escort you to your quarters?

383
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,660
请随我来
Come.

384
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,997
我们有最好的…
We have the most exquisite...

385
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:33,020
我简直不敢相信你会信任这个反社会的疯子
I can't believe you're trusting this sociopath.

386
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,880
上尉
Well, Lieutenant,

387
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,400
你做好自己的事
you got to do what you got to do,

388
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:36,780
我知道怎么跟反社会疯子打交道
and I'm kind of familiar with sociopaths.

389
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,838
我说了别带我来
I said don't bring me.

390
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,475
我想您的旅程一切顺利 先生
I trust your trip was without incident, monsieur.

391
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,860
你的团队倒是帮我把一切都打点好了
Well, your people made everything easy.

392
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,160
不胜荣幸
Our pleasure.

393
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,320
我们到了
Here we are.

394
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,280
太俗气了
So tacky.

395
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,727
但我想这就是你出名的地方
But I guess that's what you're known for.

396
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,325
这是什么？
What's this?

397
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:08,726
这东西叫相位转移器
It's called a phase pod.

398
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,103
我的某位客户送给我的礼物
A client of mine gave it to me as a gift,

399
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,438
我自己也有一个
and I got one for myself, too.

400
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:24,650
你在做什么
What are you doing?

401
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,352
宇宙中的一切
Everything in the universe vibrates

402
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,953
都以特定的波长振动
on a certain wavelength.

403
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,901
该死
Damn it.

404
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:32,959
把箱子还给我
Give me back my case.

405
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,360
我拒绝
No.

406
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,825
维修费从你的押金里出
That's coming out of your security deposit.

407
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,467
相位转移器则会改变
The phase pod changes the wavelength

408
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,069
接触到的任何东西的物质波长
of whatever they touch.

409
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:46,583
我和你不在同一相位 你也不和我在同一相位
I am out of phase with you, and you're out of phase with me.

410
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:50,509
但是我 跟你的箱子在同一相位
I am, however, in phase with your case.

411
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:55,300
然后我会把它拿走
And I will be taking it with me.

412
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:59,118
你根本不知道你挑起了什么
You have no idea what you've started.

413
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,989
哎呀
Whoopsie.

414
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:09,861
不错嘛
Impressive.

415
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,450
你真的是普通人类吗
Are you sure you're human?

416
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,700
多数时候是
Most days.

417
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,234
谢谢你
Thank you.

418
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:50,970
把箱子给我
Give me the case.

419
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,336
你是谁
Who are you?

420
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,282
他从那儿走了 那儿那儿 走那边
He went that way. That way, that way, that way!

421
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:49,962
哇 外星人
Oh, aliens.

422
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:50,950
还是裸体的
Naked aliens.

423
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,938
泽弗 快追
Go, Zeph, go.

424
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,786
他往休息室去了 天哪 他们走得真快
He's headed to the lounge. Man, they're moving fast.

425
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,453
梅尔 他朝你来了
Melle, he's coming to you.

426
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,191
哎呀
Yikes.

427
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:31,063
没事没事 我还好
No, it's okay. I'm all right.

428
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:31,900
梅尔 有看到目标吗
Melle, you got him?

429
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,575
看到了
Got him.

430
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,150
哎呀
Ooh-la-la!

431
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,610
嗨 亲爱的
Ay, amor.

432
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,600
不可能
That's not possible.

433
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,877
它已经被我销毁了
I had that destroyed.

434
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,145
不
No. No!

435
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,250
这不可能
It's not possible.

436
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,400
你知道那件武器
You knew that weapon.

437
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,575
是什么
What is it?

438
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:04,500
回答我
What is it?

439
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:09,595
行 那就来硬的
Fine. The hard way.

440
00:32:42,575 --> 00:32:45,200
永恒的祈求者恳请觐见
The Eternal Supplicant begs approach.

441
00:32:32,523 --> 00:32:34,483
（人族帝国）

442
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:38,883
（人族帝国）
（上辈子）

443
00:32:42,575 --> 00:32:45,200
永恒的祈求者恳请觐见
The Eternal Supplicant begs approach.

444
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,765
准了
You have my permission.

445
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:56,900
参见至高无上的女皇陛下
All hail Her Most Imperial Majesty,

446
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,010
崇上国母
Mother of the Fatherland,

447
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,575
- 瓦肯领主 - 你带来的是什么
- Overlord of Vulc... - What is it?

448
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,082
它完成了 陛下
It is finished, Your Majesty.

449
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,034
我的工程师们在哪
Where are my engineers?

450
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,692
他们 他们在完工后结束了自己的生命
They... they took their own lives upon completion.

451
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,300
你在为谁流泪 桑
Who is the tear for, San?

452
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,371
说
Speak.

453
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,474
是为您 陛下
It is for you, Majesty.

454
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,510
这都是
It is all...

455
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,314
为了您
...for you.

456
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,992
我再问你 桑
I asked you a question, San.

457
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,462
你为何为我而哭
Why do you cry for me?

458
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,175
看着我
Look at me.

459
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,475
你还记得我们是谁吗
Do you remember who we were?

460
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,745
在这一切之前
Before all this.

461
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:09,580
好奇的男孩
The curious boy.

462
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,351
天真的女孩
The innocent girl.

463
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:15,800
我只记得我的失败 陛下
I only remember my failure, Majesty.

464
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,657
别对我撒谎
Don't lie to me.

465
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:26,931
为了活下去 我们付出了别人无法想象的代价
We were the only ones who could understand the cost to stay alive.

466
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,768
我们是一个集体
We made a team.

467
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:33,500
彼此依靠 不可分割
We needed each other, didn't we?

468
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,310
记得那时我们是靠着什么话语 彼此支撑着活下来的吗
What did we say to carry each other through, to survive together?

469
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,147
我们虽为两人
We are two...

470
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,650
但为一体
But one.

471
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,186
我们虽为两人 但为一体
We are two but one.

472
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,455
如果我说
If I said then,

473
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:50,956
「我们逃跑吧」
"Let's run away,

474
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,950
「逃离这场竞争」
"let's flee this competition

475
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,660
「以及把我们和人族联系在一起的一切」
and everything that binds us to Terra,"

476
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,029
你会说什么呢
what would you have said?

477
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,404
您问这个问题的时机 比您认为的更富意味
The timing of your question is more poetic than you know.

478
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,369
我会答应您
I would have said yes.

479
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,050
只会在当时
Then.

480
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,850
那么现在呢
But now?

481
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:29,550
您本可以在您的治下创造一些美好的东西
You could have made something beautiful with your reign.

482
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,375
然而 您却选择了让人制造此物
Instead, you chose to build this.

483
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:35,225
这意味着我熟知的那个天真女孩
That means that innocent girl I knew,

484
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:37,569
她已经
she has been...

485
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:40,450
死了
...murdered.

486
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:42,608
怎么回事
What is this?

487
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,543
你
You...

488
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:48,380
你服用了一样的毒药?
You took the same poison?

489
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,800
不 我不许你死
No! I forbid you to die!

490
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,275
没有人愿意活在
No one wants to live

491
00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:59,225
您的统治中 皇帝
in your world, Emperor.

492
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:02,294
你就是个怪物
You are a monster!

493
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:33,400
这是什么令人愉快的地方
And what delightful place is this?

494
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,525
一个安全屋
A safe house.

495
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,228
但对你而言也许不是
But maybe not so safe for you.

496
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:39,175
既然你是31区的
You are Section 31.

497
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:42,150
你为什么不拷问我以获取答案
Why aren't you torturing answers out of me?

498
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,850
你是个暴君
You're a tyrant.

499
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,250
货真价实的
A real one.

500
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,950
折磨起不到半点作用
Torture wouldn't work.

501
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,940
你怎么会这么了解我这种人呢
How do you know so much about people like me?

502
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:55,647
是在哪里学来的暴君手段 而且学得很到位
You learned tyranny somewhere, and you learned hard.

503
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,017
藏着掖着 只证明了你的软弱
If you have to hide it, that's a weakness.

504
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:04,088
而我 不能容许搭档有这种弱点
And I can't have that in a partner.

505
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,425
我们可算不上搭档
We're not partners.

506
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:06,575
不是吗
No?

507
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:08,575
我可是帮了大忙了
I've been very helpful.

508
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:10,500
你的计划行不通
You had a plan that couldn't work.

509
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,575
而我给了你更好的
I gave you a better one.

510
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:14,025
你让我尝到了那种刺激
You gave me a taste of the action,

511
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:15,701
还明知道我会上瘾
knowing I'd want more.

512
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,970
你需要我
You need me.

513
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,206
你选择了我
You chose me.

514
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,376
为什么呢
Why?

515
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,800
不管你认为你的任务是什么
Whatever you believed your mission was,

516
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,975
这远比你想象的更糟糕
it's worse than you thought.

517
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:33,400
事关数亿万生命 时间紧迫
Billions of lives are at stake, and time is short.

518
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,188
你先让我了解你 我才能告诉你
Tell me you, and I will tell you me.

519
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:41,250
要想合作 我得知根知底
The only way this works is if I know exactly

520
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,350
说出你的身份
who I'm dealing with.

521
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,250
我也不属于这个时代
I'm not from this time, either.

522
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:01,250
我出生于20世纪的地球
I was born on Earth, 20th century.

523
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,750
这么说你已经350岁高龄了
You are 350 years old?

524
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,151
差不多
More or less.

525
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,587
大部分时间我在冬眠舱里
I slept most of that time.

526
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,557
在我被流放之后
After my exile.

527
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,562
优生战争
The Eugenics Wars.

528
00:38:19,134 --> 00:38:22,868
强化人
Augments...

529
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:24,470
夺走了我的星球
took my planet.

530
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:27,773
我的家乡
My home.

531
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,247
当时我们差不多有十个人在战斗
There was maybe ten of us who fought.

532
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,718
我认识的人不是挨了一枪就是挨了一刀
Everyone I knew either took a bullet or a blade.

533
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,685
我也还以颜色
But I gave some back.

534
00:38:44,063 --> 00:38:45,457
这让她注意到了我
She noticed me.

535
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,994
那个屠杀我家人的强化人
The Augment who slaughtered my family.

536
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:55,066
他们叫她 被标记的吉里
They called her Giri the Marked.

537
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,901
她收留了我
She took me in.

538
00:38:56,902 --> 00:39:00,300
让我比任何人类都强大
Made me stronger than any human should be.

539
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,175
她把我撕成碎片
She ripped me apart

540
00:39:02,175 --> 00:39:05,242
然后把我重塑成了她军队里的又一个强化人
and turned me into another Augment for her army.

541
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:08,600
我做了很多可怕的事
And I did terrible things.

542
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,751
却是为你这样的怪物效力
All for a monster like you.

543
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,550
因为对于暴君来说 永远只有一个选择
Because for tyrants, there is only one choice:

544
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,560
杀戮
murder.

545
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,623
但你却没杀掉我
You haven't killed me.

546
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:27,633
暂时而已
Yet.

547
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,600
我之所以能认出那个武器
I recognized the weapon because

548
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,625
因为它是我下令造的
I ordered it to be built.

549
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:42,850
召集你的人手
Gather your people.

550
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,150
每个人都得派上用场
We're gonna need every one of them.

551
00:39:59,403 --> 00:40:00,643
（加密传讯2）

552
00:40:00,643 --> 00:40:05,103
（加密传讯2）
（天赐之物）

553
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,700
在我的宇宙里
In my universe,

554
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,300
阴谋重重 政敌环伺
there were always plotters.

555
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,763
政变层出不穷
Always a coup.

556
00:40:26,763 --> 00:40:30,075
所以我造了一件武器来终结所有威胁
So I built a weapon to end all threats.

557
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:33,000
我称之为
I called it

558
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,350
「天赐之物」
the Godsend.

559
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:37,300
它会引发一种连锁反应
It triggers a chain reaction,

560
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,825
就像病毒一样在群星间传播
like a virus passing between planets.

561
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:42,306
所到之处 一切都将化为灰烬
Everything in its path incinerates.

562
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:45,250
整个象限都会消失
An entire quadrant would be lost.

563
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,700
如果我的敌人成功杀死了我
If my enemies managed to kill me,

564
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,448
那也不会有东西留给他统治
there would be nothing left to rule.

565
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,025
有个小问题
Yeah, hi. Quick question.

566
00:40:55,025 --> 00:40:55,587
不好意思
Sorry.

567
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,825
就一个很小很小的问题
Yeah, no. Uh, just a qu-- it's just a quick one.

568
00:40:57,825 --> 00:41:01,259
这是天赐之物还是天赐之暮
Is it Godsend or God's End?

569
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:03,600
天赐之物还是天赐之暮
Godsend or God's End?

570
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,050
我不明白你说的有什么区别
I don't hear a difference in what you're saying.

571
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,475
听不出来吗 「物」和「暮」
Really? Really? Godsend. God's End.

572
00:41:08,475 --> 00:41:09,375
我还是没听明白
Yeah, I'm still not getting it.

573
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:10,375
天赐之物是...
The Godsend is...

574
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:12,200
噢 天赐之物 我现在听清楚了
Wait, Godsend. I hear it now.

575
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,975
-天赐之物 不是暮 -物
- It's Godsend. No apostrophe. - Send.

576
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:15,541
天赐之物就在这个宇宙
The Godsend is here.

577
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:18,100
怎么会 那可是另一个宇宙的物品
How? It's from another universe.

578
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,850
我不知道 但那个人刚刚就拿着它
I don't know, but that man had it.

579
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,600
你以为是达达·诺伊的那个人
The one that you think is Dada Noe.

580
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,625
我们都知道是达达·诺伊的那个人
The one we know is Dada Noe.

581
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:26,800
不 他不可能是你们的达达·诺伊 
No, he's not your Dada Noe. He can't be.

582
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,225
他来自人族帝国
He's from the Terran Empire,

583
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:29,725
是他把天赐之物带来这里
and he brought the Godsend here.

584
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:32,575
不然他根本不可能知道那到底是什么
That's the only way he can know about it.

585
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:34,425
既然我们已经抓到他了
And since we have him locked up tight,

586
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,800
我要亲自审讯他
I'll interrogate him.

587
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,875
绝对不行 不能信这个女人说的话
No, no, no. We cannot trust a single word this woman says.

588
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:38,600
是啊
Yeah.

589
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,050
她害死了梅尔
She cost us Melle.

590
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,100
只有她知道我们面对的是什么人
She's the only one who knows what we're dealing with.

591
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,975
也就是她自己说的 小兄弟
Yeah, well, so she says, little bro.

592
00:41:43,975 --> 00:41:44,650
小?
Little?

593
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,175
这是身材羞辱
Scale-shamer!

594
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:48,975
微生物比恐龙更长寿
Microbes outlasted dinosaurs!

595
00:41:48,975 --> 00:41:50,700
冷静点 我要说的是
Calm your boots. What I'm saying is...

596
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,711
我要尿在你的装甲上 直到你全身生锈
I will piss in your suit until you go all rusty like!

597
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,400
这一切都是她搞砸的
...that she's the reason this is all bollixed up.

598
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,725
她导致了梅尔的死
She's the reason Melle's dead, 

599
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:58,875
她也是我们被派来这的原因
and she's the reason we're in the ass end of the galaxy.

600
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:00,018
听好了
Listen up.

601
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,175
乔久和我回船上去
Georgiou and I are gonna go back to the ship.

602
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:07,600
达达·诺伊是我们与天赐之物的唯一联系
Dada Noe is our only link to the Godsend,

603
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,329
所以我们要找他谈谈
so we're gonna have a little chat with him.

604
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,143
干什么
What?

605
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,077
她叫菲利帕·乔久
Her name is Philippa Georgiou,

606
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,125
至高无上的女皇陛下
Her Most Imperial Majesty.

607
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:30,748
崇上国母
Mother of the Fatherland.

608
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:32,250
瓦肯领主
Overlord of Vulcan.

609
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,750
克罗诺斯征服者 安多利女王
Dominus of Qo'noS, Regina Andor,

610
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,088
菲利帕·乔久·奥古斯都·伊波尼亚斯·塞塔瑞斯
Philippa Georgiou Augustus Iaponius Centarius.

611
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:39,650
酷
Cool.

612
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,700
配薯条的吗
That come with fries?

613
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,152
很好笑 对吧
That was good, right?

614
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,625
好吧
Okay.

615
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:49,133
每次你不直接回答她的问题
Every time you don't answer her questions directly,

616
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:52,270
女皇陛下就会狠狠地打你的脸
Her Majesty will punch you in your face.

617
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,225
好吧
Fine.

618
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,500
我是达达
I'm Dada.

619
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,800
达达·诺伊 先念达达 再是诺伊
Dada Noe. Just Dada, then Noe.

620
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,950
就是这样 没有中间
That's it. No in-betweens.

621
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:02,112
然后 我
And I, uh...

622
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:06,517
我以前在瓦特殖民地开过一家病理学实验室
I used to run a pathology lab in the Watt Colonies.

623
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,791
搞什么鬼
What the shit, man?!

624
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:17,028
你明明说揍我脸的会是她
You said that she was gonna be doing the face punching!

625
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:20,431
现在我俩都说谎了 你不是那个达达
So now we both have lied. You are not that Dada.

626
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,868
你是那些人口中说的他的镜像版本
You're what these people call his Mirror.

627
00:43:25,675 --> 00:43:28,350
你来自人族帝国
You came here from the Terran Empire,

628
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,700
而且还带来了天赐之物
and you brought the Godsend.

629
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,210
什么天赐之物
What's the Godsend?

630
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,250
我自己的军事委员会曾想要废黜我
My own war council tried to depose me.

631
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,250
你知道我是怎么说服元帅开口的吗
Do you know how I convinced the field marshal to talk?

632
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:49,427
我曾是个管理员
I was an administrator

633
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,450
在帝国里的武器设施工作
at an Imperial weapons facility on Terra.

634
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,000
没错
Uh, yeah.

635
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,234
天赐之物被存放在我管理的设施中
The Godsend was stored at my facility.

636
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,700
大多数人认为这只是一个传说
Most thought it was a legend,

637
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,550
但我知道这是真的
but I knew it was real.

638
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,025
所以你想卖掉它
So you tried to sell it.

639
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:04,174
是 是的
Yeah, yeah.

640
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:07,913
我想靠得来的收益安静地生活在这里
I wanted to live here quietly on its proceeds.

641
00:44:07,913 --> 00:44:09,580
你是怎么来到我们的宇宙的
How did you get to our universe?

642
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:15,653
当时发生了一场离子风暴
There was an ion storm.

643
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,275
实际上是两场
Two of them, actually.

644
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:20,550
它们像对好了表一样准时相遇
And when they converged, which they do like clockwork,

645
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,750
撕裂了帝国边界某处的时空
they ripped something open on the fringes of the Empire--

646
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,550
他们称之为异象
an anomaly, they called it--

647
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:28,375
但这实际上是一条通道
but it was a passageway

648
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,136
从人族帝国通往这里
to get to this place from the Terran Empire.

649
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:36,550
从你们宇宙的新月星云穿出
Comes out through your Crescent Nebula.

650
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,900
至少目前还是鲜有人知的
Few know about it. For now.

651
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,479
但它四小时后会重新开放
But it'll open again in four hours.

652
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:44,025
那本来是我要去见买家的时间
That's when I was supposed to be meeting my buyer.

653
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,500
你知道那武器的威力吗
Are you aware of what that weapon does?

654
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,850
人族帝国已经耗尽了所有资源
The Terran Empire's burned through its resources.

655
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,325
饥荒肆虐 饿殍遍地
There's famine.

656
00:44:50,325 --> 00:44:52,825
整个生态系统正在崩溃
Entire ecologies are collapsing.

657
00:44:52,825 --> 00:44:54,925
它们需要寻找新的领土
They need to find a new territory

658
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:57,050
进行征服和压榨
to conquer and strip-mine.

659
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,229
当他们意识到他们的超级武器不见了
When they realize that their superweapon is gone,

660
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,275
他们一定会找到那条通道
they're gonna find that passageway--

661
00:45:01,275 --> 00:45:02,975
你知道他们会的 然后来到这里
you know they will-- and they'll come

662
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:06,304
烧杀抢掠每一寸领土 再奴役余生
and they'll burn everything they touch and enslave the rest,

663
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:09,925
您的帝国向来如此 陛下
because that's what the Empire does, Majesty.

664
00:45:10,825 --> 00:45:12,625
他们学您学到了精髓
They learned well from you.

665
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:16,446
还有谁想要它？
Who else wants it?

666
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,925
我真的不知道
I-I don't know, man.

667
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:21,225
我收到了一个报价 钱是真的
I got an offer. The money was real.

668
00:45:21,225 --> 00:45:23,525
有人偷走了我们的天赐之物
Someone stole the Godsend from us.

669
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:24,500
究竟是谁
Who was he?

670
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,650
我真不清楚
No idea.

671
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,175
无论是谁闯入我的套间 偷走了那件武器
Whoever broke into my room, whoever stole that weapon,

672
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:30,175
知道这些事的人
they know what they know 

673
00:45:30,175 --> 00:45:31,950
肯定是从你们其中之一得来的
because they learned it from one of you.

674
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:54,452
紧急传送
Emergency transporter.

675
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:30,200
这下好了
Well, this is great.

676
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,150
更棒了
Oh, even better.

677
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,175
那是我们的船吗 船炸了吗
Is that... is that the ship? Is the ship gone?

678
00:46:35,175 --> 00:46:36,475
我还挺喜欢那艘船的
I liked that ship.

679
00:46:36,475 --> 00:46:37,675
什么情况
What happened?

680
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,931
有人搞破坏
Sabotage.

681
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,534
什么
What?

682
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,105
偷走天赐之物的人有一个同伙
Whoever stole the Godsend had a partner.

683
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:48,975
就在我们几个之中
It was someone here.

684
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:53,625
这意味着我们中的一个是内鬼
Which means one of us is a mole.

685
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,050
可能是你
Could be you.

686
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:01,950
原话奉还
Could be you.

687
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,825
要是我的话 我早把你们都杀了
If it were me, I would have murdered all of you already.

688
00:47:05,825 --> 00:47:07,550
大哥 你是了解我的
Look, boss, if there's a mole,

689
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,350
绝对不可能是我
you know it's not me.

690
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,725
虽然这话听起来也就很像内奸说的 我也不确定
I mean, that sounds pretty moley to me. I don't know.

691
00:47:11,525 --> 00:47:13,100
我们合作过差不多十次了
We've been on like ten ops together.

692
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,350
是没错 但我连你长什么样都不知道
Yeah, and I still don't even know what you look like, do I?

693
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:16,935
没人知道查莫人长什么样子
No one knows what a Chameloid looks like.

694
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:18,750
你可以变成任何你想变的样子
You might change into anything you want.

695
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,905
那法兹呢
What about Fuzz, huh?

696
00:47:19,905 --> 00:47:21,850
他的体型与其他人都不在一个尺度上
He exists on a whole other scale than anybody else.

697
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:22,575
转移话题是吗
Mm, deflecting?

698
00:47:22,575 --> 00:47:25,850
我的妻子即将产下我们的第一窝卵囊
My wife is about to lay our first litter of egg sacs.

699
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:29,275
而且我还有19万只幼崽正在路上
No, I have 190,000 hatchlings on the way...

700
00:47:29,275 --> 00:47:30,550
- 我希望他们活下去  - 那你听着
- and I want them to live.  - Well, look,

701
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,075
你可以在我们中的任何人找到动机
you could find a motive for any of us.

702
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:34,375
也可能是你们中任何两个的组合
Or it could be a combination of any of you.

703
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,250
你看 就像泽弗和法兹或者其他
You know, like-like Zeph and-and Fuzz or...

704
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,550
你还漏掉了梅尔
You are spinning out without Melle.

705
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,850
你根本没法做出判断
You cannot land on a choice.

706
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,350
也许是你想给我灌输这个观点
Maybe you're putting that in my head

707
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,200
因为你才是内鬼
because you're the mole.

708
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,700
又会不会是加勒特 她可是新来的
Huh? How about Garrett? She's new.

709
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:44,875
她才不在乎我们
She doesn't care about us.

710
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,375
我可是星际舰队的军官
I'm Starfleet.

711
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:50,400
还有没有人像我一样感受到一阵英雄主义的风
Anyone else feel that heroic breeze right there

712
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,302
弄乱了她的斗篷?
ruffling her cape?

713
00:47:51,302 --> 00:47:53,875
听我讲 那边有一艘旧船
Okay, there's an old ship out there,

714
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:55,075
一艘旧垃圾驳船
an old garbage scow.

715
00:47:55,075 --> 00:47:56,641
我发现它的时候你们还在
Yeah, I found it when you were up there

716
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:58,242
审问那个金属脑袋
interrogating metal head.

717
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,575
肯定已经很多年没人驾驶过它了
Must be years since anyone flew it,

718
00:48:00,575 --> 00:48:01,437
但我认为我们可以修复它
but I think we can work with it

719
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,915
开着它去追捕拿走天赐之物的人
to go after whoever took the Godsend.

720
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,283
我没那么讨厌你了
I dislike you less.

721
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:09,575
如果我想有人喜欢我 我就会养一只狗
If I wanted someone to like me, I'd get a dog.

722
00:48:10,192 --> 00:48:11,325
我喜欢秩序
I like order.

723
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:13,024
我喜欢预测和结论
I like prediction and conclusion.

724
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,750
那你可来错队伍了
Then you're on the wrong team

725
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,100
因为我们这还没揪出内鬼
because we've got mole,

726
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:19,530
被困在一颗荒无人烟的星球
stranded on a dead planet,

727
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,232
无法联络外界
no communication with the outside,

728
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,136
而且不到四个小时之后人族将得到天赐之物
and less than four hours before the Terrans get the Godsend

729
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:27,005
并在银河系的任意一处使用它
and use it anywhere in the galaxy.

730
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:28,900
说起来
Speaking of which,

731
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,075
小夸 天线阵列怎么样了
Quas, what about the antenna array?

732
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:34,175
这个嘛
Uh, well...

733
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,148
这玩意已经过时几十年了
Well, it's a couple decades out of date.

734
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:40,284
我们修复它 把目前的情况告知31区
We get it up and running, then we tell 31 what's coming.

735
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:41,552
我们齐心协力
We work together.

736
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:43,500
每个人都不要离开彼此的视线
Everyone stays in sight.

737
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,040
好
Yeah.

738
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,200
我盯着呢
Just...

739
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:51,229
干活吧
Let's go.

740
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,655
修好怕是没那么简单了
Well, there goes that idea.

741
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,915
我们的小内鬼真的很忙
Our little mole has been really busy.

742
00:49:10,915 --> 00:49:12,780
扯断了所有线路
Ripped up all the wiring.

743
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,539
分两个队 我会带一个进入树林
Two teams. I'll lead one into the woods.

744
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:14,840
我带三个人进树林
I'll lead one into the woods.

745
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,320
试试看能不能修好那艘小艇
Three to see if we can salvage that scow.

746
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,460
你和其他人一起留在这里
You stay here with the others

747
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,980
并尝试修复天线阵列
and try and fix the antenna array.

748
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,580
怎么轮到她来发号施令了
Why is she giving us orders now?

749
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,480
因为是我让的
Because I'm letting her

750
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,800
而且她十有八九不是内奸
and I'm pretty certain she's not the mole.

751
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:27,139
你可不会把赌注押在「十有八九」的身上吧
You wouldn't bet on a horse named Pretty Certain.

752
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:31,139
小夸、法兹 你们马上和乔久一起去船
Quas, Fuzz, you get to the scow right away with Georgiou.

753
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:32,760
泽弗和加勒特 你们跟我待在这
Zeph and Garrett, you stay here with me.

754
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,205
我们会搞定天线阵列的
We'll take care of the antenna array.

755
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,207
请解释一下
Uh, I'm sorry.

756
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,939
我是应该出去
I'm supposed to go out into the woods

757
00:49:37,939 --> 00:49:39,779
和两个想杀我的人一起进入树林吗
with two people who want to kill me?

758
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:41,840
保持在彼此的视线之内 别死了就行
Just stay in sight of each other and don't get dead.

759
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:42,659
好吗
Okay?

760
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,760
真是多谢了 头儿
Yep, thanks, Cap.

761
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,260
我得说 50%的几率他们中的一个想杀我
I mean, just fifty-fifty shot one of them wants to kill me,

762
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,900
还有25%的几率
and then 25%...

763
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,580
别贫嘴了小夸 快出发
Quas, just get your ass out there.

764
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:50,360
我也爱你 头儿
I love you, too, Cap.

765
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:50,899
行了行了
All righty.

766
00:49:50,899 --> 00:49:51,438
遵命
Aye, aye.

767
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,260
这艘旧船上的内部电路
The internal circuitry on this old scow

768
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,700
状态还不错
is still in decent shape.

769
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,643
我看这些应该都还能用
Everything I'm seeing should work.

770
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:17,600
所以我们正在追的东西 天赐之物
So this thing we're chasing, the Godsend,

771
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,200
你的工程师 他们安装保险没有?
your engineers, did they install a fail-safe?

772
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,121
可以远程解除它吗
Can we disable it remotely?

773
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,880
没有这种保险
There is no fail-safe.

774
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,493
我不会允许的
I wouldn't allow it.

775
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:30,960
不愧是你
How very on-brand for you.

776
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,259
可以再问你一个问题吗
Can I ask you one more question?

777
00:50:32,259 --> 00:50:34,265
真的最后一个问题了
I'm just gonna ask you one more question.

778
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:37,180
既然你主导了天赐之物的制造
So you brought the Godsend into the world

779
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:40,320
目的就是抹杀万亿条生命
to vaporize quadrillions of lives.

780
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,060
就从没想过这有点
Never thought that was a little,

781
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,800
太心狠手辣了吗
you know, much?

782
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,180
我早已下令销毁它
I ordered it destroyed.

783
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,700
但有人把它藏起来了
And someone hid it.

784
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,220
你自己的人背叛了你
Your own people betrayed you.

785
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,520
反正 你们的企业文化都烂到到不可救药了
Well, your corporate culture was straight-up shit.

786
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,680
而且你还是没回答我的问题
And you didn't answer my question.

787
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,857
渐进线圈不见了
The asymptote coil is gone.

788
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:04,339
肯定是有人为了铽元素把它拆走了
Someone must have scavenged it for the terbium.

789
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:06,800
那再找一个 这个东西应该能飞
Well, find another one, this thing should fly.

790
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,640
也许货舱就有
Maybe the cargo hull.

791
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,440
别去
Huh. Oh, no, no.

792
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,419
每个人都待在一起 好吗
Everyone stays together, all right?

793
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:15,273
降低你杀死我们的可能性
Limits the possibilities of you killing us.

794
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,109
我们去货舱吧
Let's go to the cargo hold, please.

795
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,911
你不来吗
Aren't you coming?

796
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:23,881
当然 我可太高兴了
Yes. I couldn't be more excited.

797
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,254
当然 我可以下去帮你
Yeah, I could help you down there, of course,

798
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:31,522
但考虑到 控制我们的行动
but considering how, you know, control

799
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:33,779
是你整个身份的核心
is central to your entire identity

800
00:51:33,779 --> 00:51:35,526
而我本来就不太能接受这种事
and the fact that I'm just not good at it,

801
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,680
所以我就站在这里 
I'm just gonna stand here 

802
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,464
- 为了我们的关系 什么也不做了 - 那你还真热心呢
- and honor our relationship by doing absolutely nothing. - Helpful.

803
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:42,166
这叫做彻底的自我接纳
It's called radical self-acceptance.

804
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,960
- 那你真是进步了 - 谢谢夸奖
- Evolved of you. - Well, thank you.

805
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,236
所以说 你能修好它吗？
So, can you fix it?

806
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,720
我甚至不确定它是否坏了
I'm not even sure it's broken.

807
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,307
它只是缺了个零件
It's just missing a part.

808
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,508
看这里 这些被乱扯的线路看着很严重
Look, this-this torn wiring looks dramatic,

809
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:53,800
但这设备本身就有冗余设计
but this equipment has redundancy built in.

810
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,000
有一个简单的解决办法
There's an easy work-around.

811
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,515
唯一问题是 有人取出了θ节点
Except somebody ripped out the theta junction.

812
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:00,760
除此之外 这个东西应该可以用
Other than that, this thing should work.

813
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,388
好吧 也许我们的内鬼拿走了它
Okay, well, maybe our mole has it.

814
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:09,400
加勒特?
Garrett?

815
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,280
咋了
Yeah.

816
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,980
泽弗
Zeph.

817
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,180
泽弗去哪了
Where is Zeph?

818
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:22,940
泽弗 收到请回复
Zeph, come in.

819
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:26,411
泽弗 你能听到吗
Zeph, do you copy?

820
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:35,100
泽弗
Zeph.

821
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,862
加勒特 是你做的吗
Garrett, was that you?

822
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,501
加勒特 刚刚那是什么情况
Garrett, what the hell was that?

823
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,259
有人刚激活了天线阵列
Someone just activated the antenna array.

824
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,620
该死
Damn it.

825
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,600
具体情况如何
What's happening?

826
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,919
加勒特 情况简报
Garrett, sitrep.

827
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,712
越来越棒了
This is going to be good.

828
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:04,582
上尉 收到请回复 完毕
Lieutenant, do you copy? Over.

829
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,019
安全
Clear.

830
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:15,920
安全
Clear.

831
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,894
这里什么都没有
Nothing here.

832
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:20,220
怎么会有人用这个来发出信号呢
How could someone have used this to send out a signal?

833
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,880
不可能 它少了一个部件
Impossible. It's missing a part.

834
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,299
有人把它打成了筛子
And someone shot it to hell.

835
00:53:25,299 --> 00:53:26,360
我听到有人在跑
I heard someone running.

836
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,899
泽弗一定是把θ节点放回去了
Zeph must have put the theta junction back in.

837
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:30,960
使用完毕后 射击毁掉了阵列
Then shot it after he used the array.

838
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:37,180
所以他肯定是在擅离职守后绕回来的
So he must have circled back after he went AWOL.

839
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,700
泽弗来这个星球来阻碍我们
Zeph came down to this planet to sabotage us.

840
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:43,621
现在我们被困住了
And now that we're stranded,

841
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,499
他用阵列给同谋发了信息
he sent a message to whoever he's working with.

842
00:53:46,499 --> 00:53:48,158
他会潜伏直到撤离的船抵达
And he'll lay low until his ride gets here,

843
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:50,240
然后溜之大吉
and then he's long gone.

844
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,920
那我们得先找到他
Then we need to find him first.

845
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,460
观察者 能收到吗
Observer, do you copy?

846
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,808
拜托 突袭者一号 我什么时候收不到了
Please, Raider One, when do I not copy?

847
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,011
真好笑 情况如何
That's funny. Status?

848
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,614
我检测到了不少干扰
I'm picking up a lot of interference,

849
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:12,540
但三录仪显示 泽弗的生命信号
but the tricorder shows Zeph's biosignature

850
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,719
就在这个区域 完毕
was just in this sector. Over.

851
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,723
收到 保持低调 保持队形
Copy. Stay low and tight, people.

852
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,800
你曾效力的那个军阀 吉里
The warlord you served, Giri,

853
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,740
她后来怎样了
what happened to her?

854
00:54:26,507 --> 00:54:27,980
她死了 死于生前最爱的事
She died like she lived.

855
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,867
你知道我说的什么
By that, you know what I mean.

856
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,640
她很幸运
She was lucky.

857
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,480
没染上良心这种东西
She wasn't infected with a conscience.

858
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,380
染上?
Infected?

859
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:34,960
是啊
Yeah.

860
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,200
怪物就只能是个怪物
A monster can only be a monster.

861
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,380
一个会悔恨的怪物是没用的
A monster with regrets is useless.

862
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:42,380
嗯 所以这就是你
Mm. So that's why you were hiding

863
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,920
躲在那个偏远酒吧的原因
in a bar at the ass end of nowhere.

864
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,520
也许这就是你和31区的人合作的原因
Maybe it's why you're working with 31.

865
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,000
把自己的前科抹干净
To wipe your slate clean.

866
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,760
像我们这样的人总是要付出代价的
There's always a price to pay for people like us.

867
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,323
如果你不同意 你就不会在这里
You wouldn't be here if you didn't agree.

868
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:54,620
所以这就是你选择我的原因
Oh, so that's why you chose me.

869
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,220
你认为我是一个有足够感情的怪物
You think I'm a monster who feels enough

870
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,280
可以被控制
to be controlled

871
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,139
也还能做那些脏活
but still do the real dirty work.

872
00:54:59,139 --> 00:55:01,020
不 我认为你想找回天赐之物 
No, I think you want the Godsend back 

873
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,059
因为你知道这是你救赎自己的唯一机会
because you know it's your one chance to redeem yourself

874
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:04,099
为你所做的一切赎罪
for all the shit you've done.

875
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:06,819
我想找回它 只因为它本就属于我
I want the Godsend back because it's mine.

876
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,360
泽弗的外骨骼装甲正在渗漏
Ah. Zeph's exoskeleton is leaking.

877
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:25,219
漏液更多了
Yep, more.

878
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,600
这边
This way.

879
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,720
闪
Blip,

880
00:56:05,424 --> 00:56:06,564
夹
Clip,

881
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,116
抓
Grip,

882
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:09,840
脊灰
Polio,

883
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,200
流感
Influensina,

884
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,680
牛痘
Cowpox...

885
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,140
你在念什么呢
What are you saying?

886
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,200
我正在背诵我即将孵化的幼崽的名字
I'm reciting the names of me hatchlings.

887
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:19,059
既然你们中的一个要谋杀我
Since one of you is going to murder me,

888
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:20,419
我应该是见不到他们了
I'm never gonna meet them,

889
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:21,699
但至少我可以这样纪念他们
but at least I can honor them

890
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,648
一个接一个
one by one.

891
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,880
旅行
Trip,

892
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,380
旅行二世
Trip 2,

893
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,399
扁桃体炎
Tonsilyitis,

894
00:56:28,399 --> 00:56:29,739
克里米亚-刚果出血热
Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever...

895
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,920
你要哭着念完19万孩子的名字吗
Are you gonna sob out 190,000 names?

896
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,100
你怎么能这么冷漠 如此无情
How can you be so cold and insensitive?

897
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,739
他有可能记录下了发生的一切吗
Might he have recorded what happened?

898
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:37,699
当然
Sure.

899
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:40,280
只是这段视频很可能和他一起被谋杀了
Except the footage was probably murdered along with him.

900
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,920
我们可以将三录仪连接到外骨骼装甲上
We could connect one of the tricorders to his suit.

901
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,499
就算没剩多少数据
Whatever data is left,

902
00:56:44,499 --> 00:56:45,900
凶手也昭然若揭了
we'll know who did this.

903
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,720
说得好像我们都是嫌疑人一样
You say that like we're all suspects.

904
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,419
并不是 好吗
We're not. All right?

905
00:56:50,419 --> 00:56:53,820
那时候我 法兹和乔久都在那艘船里
Fuzz, me and her were in the scow when all this happened--

906
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,880
每个人都在彼此的视线范围内
everyone in sight of everyone else.

907
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,415
没一个人乱跑 没错吧
And nobody went anywhere, right?

908
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,531
对啊
Right.

909
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,339
这不是泽弗的
Oh, this is not Zeph's.

910
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,080
深褐色头发 25厘米
Brunette. 25 centimeters.

911
00:57:26,259 --> 00:57:27,344
这太疯狂了
This is insane.

912
00:57:27,344 --> 00:57:28,540
别再坐立不安了
Stop fidgeting.

913
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,640
我已经和泽弗近距离接触了一周了
I've been in close quarters with Zeph for a week.

914
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,419
行 所以你喜欢机甲什么的
Okay, so you're into mecha boom-boom.

915
00:57:32,419 --> 00:57:34,218
很多人类都是 不必害羞
Lots of humans are. No shame.

916
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,539
<i>检测到血液</i>

917
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:42,400
呃 那不可能啊
Well, that's impossible.

918
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,779
加勒特上尉
Lieutenant Garrett,

919
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,102
<i>痕迹匹配</i>

920
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:04,649
为什么你的指甲缝里会有泽弗的血
why is Zeph's blood underneath your fingernails?

921
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,280
加勒特上尉
Lieutenant Garrett,

922
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,620
在泽弗的尸体上发现了你的证据
evidence from you was found on Zeph's body,

923
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,560
泽弗尸体上的证据也在你身上发现了
and evidence from Zeph's body was found on you.

924
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,880
不像星际舰队的作风啊
Not very Starfleet.

925
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,431
我问心无愧
Oh, I am very Starfleet.

926
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,640
你清楚凶手并不是我
And you know I didn't do this.

927
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,605
你只是害怕任何有道德准则的人
You are just terrified of anyone with a moral compass.

928
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,843
但在那颗纯洁的小心灵的深处
And deep down in that pure little heart,

929
00:58:33,779 --> 00:58:36,540
你其实是个混乱小妖精 没错吧
you're actually a chaos goblin, aren't you?

930
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,620
- 我知道你是这样的 小天使  - 别这么叫我
- I know you have it in you, angel. - Don't call me that.

931
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,620
星际舰队发现了这样的你
Starfleet sniffed you out

932
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,379
把你放在了最能发挥你作用的地方
and put you in a place where you'd be most useful.

933
00:58:43,379 --> 00:58:46,320
31区正是为那些打破规则
Section 31 is just the place for officers 

934
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,920
却又从未真正越界的军官准备的地方
who bend the rules, never quite break them until they do.

935
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,464
而你 正好适合这里
And you fit right in here.

936
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,280
你想怎么折磨我都可以
You can torture me all you want.

937
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,708
但我坚持自己没杀过人
You will never make me a murderer.

938
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:06,220
住手
No.

939
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,627
我们拿到录像了
We've got footage!

940
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,180
住手
Stop!

941
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:28,833
快住手
Stop!

942
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:32,339
这是我的装甲
This is my suit.

943
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,504
我即是装甲！
I am the suit!

944
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:37,974
装甲就是我！
The suit is me!

945
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:39,509
等一下
One second.

946
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:44,700
我们是你的朋友
We were your friends.

947
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:46,720
曾是你的朋友
We were your friends.

948
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:49,452
你杀不了我
You can't kill me.

949
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:50,220
泽弗 别
Zeph, no.

950
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,280
你不能
You can't kill...

951
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,080
泽弗是自杀的?
Zeph killed himself?

952
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,831
他为什么要这么做
Why would he do that?

953
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,720
抱歉让您失望了 陛下
Sorry to disappoint you, Your Majesty.

954
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,459
这一切根本说不通
Look, none of this is making any sense.

955
01:00:09,459 --> 01:00:10,819
是啊 非常之不合理
No, none of it makes a lick of sense.

956
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:12,259
他为什么要这样做呢
Why would he do this?

957
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,980
给我几分钟时间
Give me a couple minutes to...

958
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:14,920
我们没时间了
We don't have minutes.

959
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,881
那就几秒钟行了没
Well, then give me a couple seconds, then.

960
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,640
可能是你
Could be you.

961
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,420
原话奉还
Could be you.

962
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,920
但我连你长什么样都不知道
And I still don't even know what you look like.

963
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,880
你可以变成任何你想变的样子
You could change into anything you want.

964
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,419
她是新来的 她才不在乎我们
She's new. She doesn't care about us.

965
01:00:26,419 --> 01:00:27,360
我可是星际舰队的军官
I'm Starfleet.

966
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,939
当你在说我这套装甲的时候
When you are talking about the suit,

967
01:00:30,448 --> 01:00:32,040
就是在说我
you're talking about Zeph.

968
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,219
这可不是法兹
This isn't Fuzz.

969
01:00:33,219 --> 01:00:34,998
这个瓦肯外表不过是台机器
The Vulcan's just a machine, you know.

970
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:36,532
我在里面呢
I'm inside.

971
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:38,200
这是身材羞辱
Scale-shamer!

972
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,180
你绝对想不到我能进入多小的地方
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

973
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:45,875
比如 身体改造组件的内部空间
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

974
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,699
当时他启用了自动驾驶
There's an autopilot.

975
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:49,980
这是唯一合理的解释
That's the only thing that makes sense.

976
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,953
你给瓦肯机器设定了自动驾驶程序
You set the Vulcan machine on autopilot.

977
01:00:57,454 --> 01:01:01,190
所以当时它的反应才那么古怪
That's why its responses were so strange.

978
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:02,960
你来不来
Aren't you coming?

979
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,340
当然
Yes.

980
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,198
你钻进了泽弗的外骨骼装甲
You flew into Zeph's exoskeleton.

981
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,560
你钻进去之后
And once you were inside...

982
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,500
有人把西塔接口拆掉了
Somebody ripped out  the theta junction.

983
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,960
加勒特 泽弗去哪了
Garrett, where's Zeph?

984
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:19,360
然后你控制了泽弗的装甲
Then you took control of Zeph's suit.

985
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,360
当别人在找他的时候
While the others were out looking for him,

986
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,581
你控制他溜回了通讯阵列
you made him sneak back into the antenna array

987
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:27,219
然后发送了那些信息
and send those messages.

988
01:01:28,259 --> 01:01:30,019
不要这么做
Don't do this to them!

989
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,300
我们是你的朋友啊
We were your friends.

990
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,091
然后你销毁了所有证据
Then you destroyed the evidence.

991
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,626
还杀掉了泽弗
And you killed Zeph.

992
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,760
然后你再把这一切嫁祸给加勒特
And then you planted the evidence on Garrett here.

993
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:47,280
举起手来 法兹
Hands up, Fuzz.

994
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,840
真是倒了血霉了
Oh, shite and ever shite.

995
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,980
阿洛克 你不会真的要信她的鬼话吧
You're honestly gonna believe what she says, Alok?

996
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,160
夸西 我们一起经历了这么多 你也信她的话吗
Quasi, after everything we've been through?

997
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,391
我能先说一句吗
C-Can I just say one thing first?

998
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,264
泽弗的外骨骼我还控制着呢
I'm still hacked into Zeph's exoskeleton.

999
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:28,979
喂
Come on!

1000
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,053
说好的「不抛弃任何人」呢
What happened to "no crew member left behind"?

1001
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,080
快一点啊
Come on, come on!

1002
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,106
靠近他们
Get us closer.

1003
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:09,280
接住你了
I got you. I got you.

1004
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,600
还好有我
Nice and easy.

1005
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,459
该死
Damn.

1006
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:12,920
你很关注黑市的动向 没错吧
You keep tabs on the black market, hmm?

1007
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,720
你就是在那听说天赐之物的消息的
And that's where you heard about the Godsend.

1008
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,080
你在乎这些干什么
Why do you care?

1009
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,847
家人你都下得去手
You killed your family.

1010
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:19,516
再多点人算什么呢
What's a few billion more people, huh?

1011
01:05:20,259 --> 01:05:22,739
天赐之物在哪 你的同谋是谁
Where is it? And who are you working with?

1012
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:24,120
你登上了皇位
You took your crown

1013
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,424
他们却痛苦地死在你的脚边
while they died in agony not ten feet away.

1014
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,840
你奴役了你唯一的朋友
You condemned your only friend to slavery,

1015
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:35,164
居然还有脸在最后一刻给他一些怜悯?
and then you had the balls to offer him kindness at the end?

1016
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,236
你怎么会知道的
How could you know that?

1017
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,740
你终于发现了
Glad you're catching on.

1018
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:44,008
他把你耍了 女皇陛下
He played you, Emperor.

1019
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,043
桑还活着
San's alive.

1020
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,183
不可能
It's not possible.

1021
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,739
绝对不可能 到底怎么回事
That's not possible. How?

1022
01:05:56,739 --> 01:05:59,556
他训练出了对毒药的抗药性
He built up an immunity from that poison, you know.

1023
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:02,726
每次只多服用很小的剂量
Teeny tiny doses over time.

1024
01:06:03,994 --> 01:06:07,779
看样子是小混蛋又赢了一次
Once again, small shite for the win, mama.

1025
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:10,620
他在哪
Where is he?!

1026
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,819
期待他的精彩表演吧
He's gonna put on quite the show.

1027
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,379
你制造了天赐之物
You built the Godsend.

1028
01:06:15,379 --> 01:06:17,299
你制造了一个怪物
You made this monster.

1029
01:06:17,299 --> 01:06:19,209
全是因为你
This is all you.

1030
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,387
小心点可以吗
Be careful, all right?

1031
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,040
我让你小心点
I said be careful.

1032
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,019
我还得用它活动呢
I have to get around in that.

1033
01:07:13,672 --> 01:07:15,465
你都能买得起一百多具身体了 还在乎这一具
You can afford a hundred of them now.

1034
01:07:15,465 --> 01:07:16,666
太好了
Oh, great.

1035
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,320
这个能用不就行了
I'd settle for one that works.

1036
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:23,000
所以就是这个
So that's it?

1037
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,520
无敌的天赐之物
The almighty Godsend.

1038
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,000
等你做上皇帝了
When you're emperor,

1039
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,640
能不能给它换个没那么奇怪的名字
maybe start by naming it something less confusing.

1040
01:07:34,923 --> 01:07:37,822
<i>离子风暴会聚倒计时</i>

1041
01:07:43,539 --> 01:07:45,128
跨越两个宇宙的通道打开时
Once that passageway opens up,

1042
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:48,200
他会联系人族 他们会从中进入
he contacts the Terrans, they come through.

1043
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,301
然后他们会在此引爆
They're detonating it here.

1044
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,580
他就会成为帝国的新宠
And he'd be the darling of the Empire.

1045
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:58,339
发生这样的灾难 星联就会陷入混乱
So he throws the Federation into chaos...

1046
01:07:58,339 --> 01:08:00,419
星际舰队自顾不暇
Starfleet will start scrambling.

1047
01:08:00,419 --> 01:08:01,978
入侵的完美时机
Perfect time to invade.

1048
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,540
你创造了它
You gave birth to this thing.

1049
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,040
我们要如何阻止
How do we stop it?

1050
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,100
没办法
We don't.

1051
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,539
我们被困在这 追不上他
We're trapped here, so we can't follow him.

1052
01:08:13,539 --> 01:08:15,720
通讯天线坏了 我们也无法警告任何人
The antenna's destroyed, so we can't warn anybody.

1053
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,026
胡扯
That is bullshit.

1054
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:19,459
你肯定有更好的办法
You can do better than that.

1055
01:08:19,459 --> 01:08:20,230
我做不到
I can't.

1056
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,660
天赐之物就像我自己
The Godsend is me.

1057
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:23,640
我唯一无法战胜的就是自己
I'm the only one I could never defeat.

1058
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,373
过去总是缠着你不放
The past always catches up with you.

1059
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:30,819
不是吗
Right?

1060
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,880
但并不意味着它总能赢
Doesn't mean it always wins.

1061
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,985
每个安全屋都有备用计划
Every safe house, I have a backup plan.

1062
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:43,440
把那艘垃圾船修好
We'll get that scow running.

1063
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,856
老大 那家伙飞不起来的
Boss, the scow won't fly.

1064
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,700
没有渐进线圈就不可能
Not without an asymptote coil.

1065
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,296
我们有一个
We have one.

1066
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:54,198
我们必须追上桑
We'll catch up with San.

1067
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:55,740
我们要阻止他联系人族帝国
We'll make sure he can't contact the Terrans.

1068
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,202
你早把线圈拆出来了
You ripped out the coil.

1069
01:08:58,202 --> 01:09:00,570
有内奸在 我可没法什么都说出来
Couldn't tell you while a mole was still running around.

1070
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:05,409
你个混蛋
Asshole.

1071
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:20,457
小夸 去帮她一下
Okay, Quas, give her a rip.

1072
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,481
还是只有一下反应
Still just one pulse.

1073
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,538
来活了 朋友们
And we're in business.

1074
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:38,220
我们只有不到三十分钟时间
Okay, team, we have less than 30 minutes.

1075
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:40,160
小夸 设定航线前往新月星云
Quas, set a course for the Crescent Nebula.

1076
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,760
路上将会非常颠簸
All right, this is gonna be bumpy and bad.

1077
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,800
我推测桑的星舰会有武器
I'm assuming San's ship will be armed.

1078
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,640
废话 人族帝国能有不武装的星舰吗
Yeah, every Terran ship's armed.

1079
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,040
对方有质子加农炮 鱼雷
He'll have proton cannons, torpedoes,

1080
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,656
而我们只有一堆垃圾
and we are a garbage barge.

1081
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:54,324
有啥好笑的
Why are you laughing?

1082
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:56,460
因为我想不出来还有什么更糟的情况了
Because I can't imagine things getting much worse.

1083
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,399
出发
Let's go.

1084
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,078
所以 这艘船会在自身周围制造牵引力场
So, this thing flies around in the middle of a tractor field.

1085
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:18,280
人们向太空里面扔垃圾
People jettison their garbage into space,

1086
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,360
然后这种驳船会拖着垃圾和力场
and the scow flies around and drags the trash

1087
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,380
一起飞行
along with the field.

1088
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,400
牵引力场里塞满垃圾之后
Once the tractor field is full,

1089
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,220
就会一起把垃圾甩进星云里
it dumps the trash in the Nebula

1090
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:28,000
让垃圾在辐射里自行分解
where it disintegrates in the radiation.

1091
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,920
我就是想确认一下
I just want to be clear.

1092
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,020
你是说我们最有可能用的上的武器
You're saying that our best potential weapon is

1093
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:33,620
是用来拖垃圾的牵引光束吗
a beam for collecting garbage?

1094
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,420
没错
Yes.

1095
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:35,020
那太棒了
Great.

1096
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,567
提醒下 你在那指手画脚帮不上一点忙
Hey, being judgy never helped anything.

1097
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,620
你要去哪
Where are you going?

1098
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:41,520
轮机室
Engineering.

1099
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,000
如果那是我们唯一的武器
If that's our only weapon,

1100
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,200
我要把所有的能量都导入那里
I'll redirect all power to the tractor beams.

1101
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,010
这计划确实不错呢
That's actually a good plan.

1102
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,580
（加密传讯3）

1103
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:54,480
（加密传讯3）
（跨越宇宙的通道）

1104
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:08,880
我们就位了
We're in position.

1105
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,080
通道很快就会打开
The passageway will open soon.

1106
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,303
你知道我在这一切结束后想干什么吗
Do you know what I want when this is all over?

1107
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:16,600
这么大的一块空域
Just a big space, you know,

1108
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,476
我要和我的小家伙们到处乱飞
for me hatchlings to tunnel and fly around and...

1109
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,220
那你呢
What do you want?

1110
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:25,514
我要菲利帕乔久永远沉沦于她的失败之中
I want Philippa Georgiou to marinate in her own defeat.

1111
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,680
我明白你们之间是那种
I get you guys are all 

1112
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,600
「永恒宿敌 性感的邪恶张力」之类的关系
"eternal nemesis, sexy evil tension" and stuff, but...

1113
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,180
警报
Alert.

1114
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,390
有飞船靠近
Incoming vessel.

1115
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:36,325
检测到碰撞航线
Collision trajectory detected.

1116
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,595
她确实能把那玩意飞起来
Of course she got it off the ground.

1117
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,998
我建议用鱼雷解决他们
I say we should use the torpedoes.

1118
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,060
对方发现我们了
They've picked us up.

1119
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,980
光子鱼雷来袭
Photon torpedo incoming.

1120
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:51,160
击中倒计时
Impact in five, four...

1121
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,080
是时候进行规避机动了吧
Really want to take evasive action right now!

1122
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,079
小夸 维持航线 护盾强度设置到最大
Quas, hold the course. Put everything in our shields.

1123
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,660
她为什么不改变航线呢
Why isn't she changing course?

1124
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,280
我看起来像是算命师吗
Do I look like a fortune teller?

1125
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,660
我们有足够的能量使用牵引光束锁定他们吗
Do we have enough juice to drag them with the tractor beam yet?

1126
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,280
有 但我们没法再承受鱼雷的直接命中了
Yeah, but we can't take another direct hit.

1127
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,220
鱼雷即将命中 五 四 三
Incoming torpedo in five, four...

1128
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:18,101
先维持航线 我们马上就位了
Keep it steady. We're almost there...

1129
01:12:18,101 --> 01:12:18,720
闪避
Now.

1130
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,382
警告 导航控制功能失效
Alert. Navigation control suspended.

1131
01:12:32,382 --> 01:12:35,118
他们在干什么 想拽死我们吗
What are they gonna do, drag us to death?

1132
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,940
她在阻止我和帝国取得联系
She's trying to stop me from reaching the Empire.

1133
01:12:44,461 --> 01:12:46,500
怎么样 大家没事吧
How's everybody feeling about this?

1134
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,360
这是唯一的办法了
It's the only way.

1135
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,632
这办法有用
This can work.

1136
01:12:48,632 --> 01:12:50,880
辐射会削减他们的护盾
The radiation will wear down their shields.

1137
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,400
是啊 但是辐射也会影响我们
Yeah, the thing is, the radiation hits us, too.

1138
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,940
目标锁定系统失效
Target lock malfunction.

1139
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,280
鱼雷无法锁定目标 加农炮也离线了
I can't get torpedo lock. Cannons offline.

1140
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,509
桑?
San?

1141
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,748
桑
San.

1142
01:13:05,749 --> 01:13:07,517
桑!
San!

1143
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,994
辐射已达致命水平
Radiation levels critical.

1144
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,520
护盾失效 重复 护盾失效了
Shields are down. I repeat, shields are down!

1145
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,869
他的呢
And San's?

1146
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:27,940
还剩12% 仍在迅速下降
His are at 12% and falling fast.

1147
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:29,200
等离子辐射来袭
Plasma incoming!

1148
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,440
如果我们被卷入这样的爆炸里
We get caught with a burst like that,

1149
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,980
我们就完了
and we're done.

1150
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,143
这就是混乱 加勒特
This is chaos, Garrett.

1151
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,900
你喜欢混乱没错吧
You know you love it, hmm?

1152
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,220
直面它 接纳它 享受混乱
Maybe let it in, make out with it a little.

1153
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,900
这就是星际舰队派你到此的原因
It's why Starfleet put you here.

1154
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,560
混乱就像是我的炮友
Chaos is my friend with benefits.

1155
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,720
就是这样 越混乱越好
Yeah, Garrett, let's get messy.

1156
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,400
怎么样
Hmm?

1157
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:47,760
当然
Okay.

1158
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,560
加油 小夸 你能行的
You got this, Quas.

1159
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,360
没问题
Uh-huh.

1160
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,627
准备好了吗
You ready?

1161
01:13:50,627 --> 01:13:52,061
桑的护盾只有4%了
San's shields are at four percent.

1162
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,240
最后2%
Two now.

1163
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,920
他的护盾已失效
His shields are down.

1164
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:58,760
可以出发了
Good to go.

1165
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:38,460
菲利帕
Philippa!

1166
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,000
我们这次
This contest only ends

1167
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,053
不死不休
when one of us is dead!

1168
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,194
引爆程序已启动
Detonation sequence activating.

1169
01:15:00,764 --> 01:15:01,960
听好了 我们纳米人
See, the Nanokins,

1170
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,240
不需要星际联邦
we don't need the Federation.

1171
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,160
向来如此
We never have.

1172
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,920
早在你们这些庞然大物发现我们之前我们就在统治了
We ruled before you behemoths found us,

1173
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,306
在你们死后 我们会再次统治
and we will rule again after you're gone.

1174
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,449
猜猜谁会在待会的大爆炸中存活下来
Guess who survives very large explosions.

1175
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,340
是我们纳米人
Very small things.

1176
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,980
好了 我先失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1177
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,480
我得让船脱离牵引光束
I need to cut our ship loose.

1178
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,500
如果你的朋友在这个过程里死了那真是抱歉
Sorry if your friends die in the process.

1179
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,094
不 我在开玩笑
No, I'm joking.

1180
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:33,580
我等不及要杀死他们了
I can't wait to kill them.

1181
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:36,399
再见了 你个巨大狗屎
So long, you big lumps of shite!

1182
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,460
谁在驾驶那艘飞船
Who's flying that?

1183
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:58,320
根据传感器 上面有一个微型生命
Uh, according to the sensors, one tiny life-form on board,

1184
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,856
它在朝我们飞来
and it's heading right for us.

1185
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:04,820
导弹锁定
Plot missile lock.

1186
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:07,263
我们只有垃圾 明白吗 只有垃圾
We have trash, all right? Just trash.

1187
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,240
但为一体
But one.

1188
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,272
桑
San.

1189
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:39,929
等待确认生物签名
Awaiting biosignature confirmation.

1190
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:42,860
我追踪到法兹的穿梭艇了
I've got Fuzz's shuttle.

1191
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,300
他要回到桑的船上
He's heading back to San's ship.

1192
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,500
我们只能勉强跟上
We're barely keeping up.

1193
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:46,602
跟住他
Stay on him.

1194
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,620
提醒下 我们没有任何武器
Uh, we don't have any weapons.

1195
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:50,160
我们有一个满载垃圾的货舱
We have a payload bay full of trash.

1196
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,460
不要跟丢那个穿梭艇
Do not lose that shuttle.

1197
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,160
好吧
Okay.

1198
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,182
我曾经什么都不是
I was nothing!

1199
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,018
那个男孩软弱无力
That boy was soft, weak.

1200
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:07,090
但在你脚下服侍的这些年教出了现在的我
But all those years under your heel taught me who I am now.

1201
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:10,226
帝国舰队将会穿过通道过来
The Empire's coming through that portal.

1202
01:17:10,226 --> 01:17:11,600
我的帝国
My Empire!

1203
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,900
我们将统治这个宇宙
And we will reign over this universe

1204
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,080
用公正又仁慈的手段 不像你
with righteous mercy, not like you!

1205
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,939
从来不会有仁慈的独裁者 桑
There are no benevolent dictators, San.

1206
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,513
这是你教会我的
You taught me that.

1207
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,817
我们还能回头
We can come back from this.

1208
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,655
我们可以重新开始
We can start over.

1209
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,140
我爱混乱
Oh, I love chaos.

1210
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:58,580
混乱是我的菜
Chaos is my jam.

1211
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,100
我爱混乱
I love chaos.

1212
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:03,400
加勒特 你在那里边干啥呢
Garrett, what the hell are you doing down there?

1213
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,100
夸西 我是个训练有素的星际舰队军官
Quasi, I am a trained Starfleet officer

1214
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,300
我也非常希望活得到能当上舰长的那一天
who fully intends on living long enough to be captain one day.

1215
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,960
你得相信我 好吗
You got to trust me, okay?

1216
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,200
你好呀
Hi there.

1217
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,060
真高兴你找到了我
I'm so glad you found me.

1218
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,023
你刚刚说啥了
What'd you just say?

1219
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,420
是玩具说的
It's a toy.

1220
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:20,460
看起来它来自一个德鲁姆行星
Looks like it came from a Droom planet.

1221
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:22,597
来一起找点乐子怎么样
Shall we do something fun together?

1222
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,062
你还好吗 星际舰队女士
You okay down there, Starfleet?

1223
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:33,380
哦 拜托 拜托 拜托 太好了
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yes.

1224
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:36,040
我们不允许德鲁姆科技进入联邦
Oh, we do not let Droom tech into the Federation

1225
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,581
因为他们用特瑞金作为电源
because they use Terrenium as a power source.

1226
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:41,140
你是准备炸飞我们吗
Oh, you're gonna blow us up, aren't you?

1227
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:43,320
你最好希望这艘船的船体
You better hope that this ship's hull

1228
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,021
用特莫矿加固过

1229
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:13,382
我是一名科学官

1230
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,985
而科学就是受控的混乱
And science is just controlled chaos.

1231
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,620
混乱 混乱 混乱
Whoa, chaos, chaos!

1232

1236
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:05,600
维持位置在法兹的飞船前
Stay in front of Fuzz's ship

1237
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,840
这样才能打开舱门往上倒垃圾
so we can open the payload bay.

1238
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,740
呃 好
Uh, yeah.

1239
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,406

夸西 马上就要发生非常大的爆炸

1242
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,244
这个控制台的语言我看不懂
This console's in a language I don't know.

1243
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,645
我能破译其中一些
I can decipher some of it.

1244
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,081
我只需要把它分解成语素
I just have to break it down to morphemes

1245
01:20:18,081 --> 01:20:18,560
然后 你知道
and, you know...

1246
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,748
大爆炸要来了啊
Large explosion impending.

1247
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:22,385
这两个按钮都有可能打开货舱
Either of these two buttons could open the cargo bay.

1248
01:20:22,385 --> 01:20:23,280
好啊 那就都按了
Okay, so push them both.

1249
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,954
这两个按钮也都有可能
Either of these two buttons could also

1250
01:20:24,954 --> 01:20:26,420
启动自毁程序
initiate a self-destruct protocol.

1251
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:27,660
反正怎样都是爆炸呗
We're gonna blow up anyway.

1252
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:28,424
嗯哼
Uh-huh

1253
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:30,540
夸西 夸西 看着我
Quasi. Quasi, look at me.

1254
01:20:30,927 --> 01:20:32,300
你只需要做个决定
You just need to make a call.

1255
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:34,476
你知道该做什么
You know what to do.

01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:35,667
好

你想听点有趣的事吗
Do you want to hear something funny?

1259
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,961
我在自动驾驶状态
I'm on autopilot.

1260
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,260
什么鬼
What the hell?

1261

我们都要死了
We're all gonna die.

1262
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:54,643
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die.
