00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,560
她回来了
She's back!

8
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,771
她回家了
She's home!

9
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,920
菲莉帕回家了
Philippa came home!

10
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:30,082
两年过去了
Two years,

11
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:34,154
一切都还和我记忆中一样
and everything looks exactly as I remember.

12
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:39,159
我本以为自己永远没法回家了
I never thought I would see this place again.

13
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,666
这次我们有18人
There were 18 of us this time.

14
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,740
都是从帝国的各个角落
Culled from every corner of the Empire

15
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,139
被抓到地球参加比赛
and brought to Terra for the contest.

16
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,608
我们被告知 接下来的几年里
We were told that only one of us would survive

17
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,878
我们当中只有一个人能活下来
the years to come.

18
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,114
只有一个孩子
One child

19
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,887
能代表最纯粹的地球血统
the purest expression of the Terran identity.

20
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:11,124
他们让我们互相残杀
They pitted us against each other.

21
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:15,229
过了一个又一个月 人数逐渐减少
And month by month, our numbers dwindled.

22
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,368
那 你赢了吗
Did... did you win?

23
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,040
比赛结束了吗
Is it over?

24
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,939
还有两个人活着

26

我和桑

27
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,758
我们
We are two

28
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,200
双生一体
but one.

29
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,716
直至永恒
Forever.

30
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,301
竞赛当中禁止出现「朋友」这个词
The word "friend" was forbidden during the contest,

31
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:56,604
但我们在别人听不到的时候向对方耳语说出这个词
but we whispered it to each other when no one could hear.

32
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,300
桑和我将我们的技能结合起来
San and I combined our skills

33
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,320
一起对付监察者和其他参赛者
against the proctor and the other contestants.

34
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,113
但你们当中只有一个人能成为皇帝
But only one of you could be emperor.

35
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,518
还剩下最后一个任务
One task remains.

36
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:14,922
最先完成任务的人就可以统治帝国
The first to complete it rules the Empire,

37
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,600
而另一个人
and the other spends the rest of their life

38
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,140
将终生侍奉新皇
in servitude to the new emperor.

39
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,194
你要做什么
What do you have to do?

40
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,078
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,048
你做了什么
What did you do?!

42
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:46,052
一切旧日牵绊 皆不可再续
No ties to the old life are permitted.

43
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,791
人族的帝皇唯忠于职责
An emperor can only be loyal to duty.

44
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,894
如此帝国方能强盛
Thus does the Empire remain strong.

45
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,365
如此帝国方能扩张
Thus does it grow.

妈妈

47
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,626
菲莉帕
Philippa.

48
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,340
你完成了你的对手无法下手的任务
You succeeded where your competitor could not.

49
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,833
把他带过来
Bring him here.

50
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,872
桑缺乏勇气 没能通过最后的试炼
San did not have the strength to pass the final test.

51
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:51,479
现在 他的村庄仍在烈火中燃烧 昭示着他的懦弱
Even now, his village burns as a testament to his cowardice.

52
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,584
我爱你
I love you.

53
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,654
你赢得了比赛

54
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:04,056

桑  走上前
San, step forward.

56
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,814
现在你的生命只为侍奉于她的足下
You live now only to serve at her heel.

57
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,362
跪下 向主宰你生命的皇帝臣服
Kneel before the one who owns your life.

58
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,578
我们双生
We are two...

59
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,147
一体
But one.

60
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,584
不再是了
Not anymore.

61

我是总控
This is Control

65
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,540
有一条发给阿尔法小队队长的最高优先级讯息

66
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,945
你们的新目标是菲莉帕·乔久皇帝
Your subject is Emperor Philippa Georgiou,

67
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,715
地球帝国前任统治者
former ruler of the Terran Empire.

68
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,381
地球帝国存在于一个平行宇宙
It's in a parallel universe

69
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,780
在已知历史记录中
with the most criminal population

70
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,153
该帝国的臣民最为残暴
in recorded history.

71
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,658
即使在那个宇宙 乔久仍能以暴政完全掌控帝国的每个角落
Even there, Georgiou had the market cornered on atrocities.

72
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,780
2257年 她被带到我们的宇宙
In 2257, she was brought to our universe

73
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,960
并加入31区
and joined Section 31,

74
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,840
但几年后 我们失去了联络
but after a few years, we lost contact.

75
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,740
（联络丢失）

76
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,420
近日 我们联邦领土边境外的区域
Recently, Georgiou was spotted using an alias

77
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,442
发现菲莉帕·乔久以化名出现
in the border territory outside Federation space,

78
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:40,900
该地正是我们追踪黑市新威胁的关键区域
where we're tracking a new threat on the black market.

79
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,883
接下来的任务，就交给你们了
This is where your team comes in.

80
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:47,140
联邦签订的条约禁止我们跨越边界
Federation treaty forbids us from crossing over that border,

81
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,660
也就意味着星际舰队不能暗中行事
which means Starfleet cannot get its hands dirty.

82
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,827
你和你31区的队伍将前往与乔久联络
You and your 31 team will go in, make contact with Georgiou

83
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:57,300
发现并控制那个威胁

84
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,068
但需注意
But make no mistake

85
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,972
恶犬咬人 多加小心
this dog bites, so watch your backs.

86
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,575
你们只有24小时的时间完成任务
You have 24 hours to complete the mission.

87
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,560
动身吧
Get to work.

88
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560

蜜月套房里出了个小事故
Small incident in the honeymoon suite.

94
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,740
似乎是一位新娘
I'm afraid the bride molted

95
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,751
在快到高潮的时候蜕皮了
just as things were coming to a climax.

96
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,640
维吉尔 说重点
Virgil,get to the point.

97
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,300
我派出了一支生化小队 并致以你的吊唁
I sent a biohazard team and your condolences.

98
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,829
另外 有一位顾客想和你说句话
Also, there's a customer hoping for a word with you.

99
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:13,500
他看起来很清醒 但已经喝了不少
He seems entirely sober but quite intoxicating.

100
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,575
维罗妮克·杜·弗朗克女士同意见你

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,920
他说就约现在 女士
Now, madame.

107
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,940
（法语）
Impossible.

108
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,284
她说不可能
Impossible.

109
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,547
先退下吧 维吉尔
Au revoir, Virgil.

110
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,040
这玩意儿是非法的
That is illegal.

111
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,701
但能赚大钱
And that makes money.

112

我这里是声誉良好的生意场所
This is a reputable establishment.

113
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,800
据我所知可不是这样
Not what I heard.

114
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,806
我们为什么不去你的办公室讨论呢
Why don't we discuss it in your office?

115
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:32,340
我为什么要带你去我的办公室呢 阿洛克·萨哈
Why would I take you to my office, Alok Sahar?

116
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,916
因为这玩意儿得自己试试
Because it's a hands-on experience.

117
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,694
我所到之处
♪ Everywhere I go ♪

118
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,362

00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,075
你要来点吗
Have you partaken?

123
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,414
这将是我为数不多的几次初体验
This would be one of my few first times.

124
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,381
来一杯潘趣酒

好了 别说废话了
Now, let's cut the shit.

130
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,040
31区来我的空间站干什么
What is Section 31 doing in my space station?

131
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,400
你觉得我会认不出来一个特工吗
Hmm? You think I don't know an agent when I see one?

132
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,991
你带领着一个六人小队
You're heading up a team of six operatives,

133
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,460
分散在这个酒吧里
and they're all over the bar.

134
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,497
有一个查莫人
There's the Chameloid,

135
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,200
一个绿血变形人
a green-blooded shape-shifter,

136
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,171
假装在与一个德尔塔人*调情寻欢
trying to muster sexy time with a Deltan,

137
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:05,904
多么甜蜜的人形陷阱
a walking honey trap

138
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,142
31区用来转移注意力的惯用伎俩

可实际上查莫人是银河系里唯一

140
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:16,749
对德尔塔人的魅惑能力保持免疫的种族

141
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,320
然后是那个穿着一身高端器械的家伙
Then there's the guy with all the high-end mech,

142
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:24,456
傻站在后面 显得好像他有脑子似的
standing in the back, looking like he has thoughts.

143
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,459
机械生命 有的可不只是蛮力

144
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,266
实际上更头脑简单 四肢发达

145
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,202
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

146
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,020
还有那位瓦肯人
And we can't forget the Vulcan,

147
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,340
被舞台表演逗得哈哈大笑
laughing way too hard at the stage banter.

148
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,347
鉴于瓦肯人从来不笑 他要么也是个白痴
And since Vulcans never laugh, he's either an idiot, too,

149
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:50,817
要么就是在庞发期间脑子变得不正常了
or lost his mind during pon farr and went insane.

150
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,754
拜托 那明明很好笑啊
Oh, come on. That was funny.

151
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,840
还有你安排给他那个特别正经的人类搭档
And the very serious human you stuck him with...

152
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,292
你控制一下自己
Reel it in anytime.

153
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,000
她看着就是一副苦大仇深的样子
...she's got a stick so far up her backside,

154
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
一开口就能听出来
it's coming out her mouth.

155
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,065
冷静一点
Just reel it in.

That would be

157
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,500
加勒特上尉*
Lieutenant Garrett.

158
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,580
星际舰队的
Starfleet.

159
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,746
无趣到死
Where fun goes to die.

160
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:23,016
你找我花了不少时间啊
It took you long enough to find me.

161
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,380
只要你留在巴拉姆空间站
We knew that having you here on the Baraam

162
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,321
对我们来说 总有一天会派上用场
would be valuable to us one day.

163
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,420
好吧 我不得不说我一点儿也不感动
Well, I'm not feeling motivated to be valuable

164
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,894
我只为自己所用
to anyone but myself.

165
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:42,202
今夜请说愿意
♪ Say yes tonight ♪

166
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:45,660
一切都可应允
♪ Say yes to everything... ♪

167
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,008
所以 我们就这么开始谈判？
So, is this where we start negotiating?

168
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,210
那要看情况了
Hmm, that depends.

169
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,380
你们是何时发现我的
How long have you known about me?

170
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,200
从你自前任站主那儿接手开始 我们就知道了
Ever since you took over from the previous owner,

171
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,950
而那位站主到现在依然下落不明
who we still haven't found.

172
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,120
其他的前站主也是
Well, all of.

173
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,360
这可不是我干的
That wasn't me.

174
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,421
乔久皇帝
Emperor Georgiou,

175
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,120
我完全有权逮捕你
I am authorized to arrest you

176
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
抹除你的意识
and wipe your mind clean.

177
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,260
但是话又说回来 我心里还是觉得
But then again, there's a part of me

178
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,662
你更应当背负那些不堪回忆而活
that wants you to live with your memories.

179
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,265
尤其种族灭绝的那些
The genocidal ones.

180
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,203
你有权逮捕我
Being authorized to arrest me

181
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:20,180
不等于你有能力逮捕我
isn't the same as being able to arrest me.

182
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,260
你真的希望31区 希望我
You really want Section 31-- want me--

183
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,944
不止不休地追着你吗
dogging you until the end of time?

184
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,380
无聊
Boring.

185
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,817
往事如影随形啊
The past always catches up with you.

186
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:34,260
以及 我知道我们都讨厌这一点
And as much as both of us might hate it, 

187
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,340
但我会帮你个忙
I'm doing you a favor.

188
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,100
最后一次任务
One last mission.

189
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,627
听着
Listen.

190
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,900
你相信命运吗
Do you believe in fate?

191
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,465
我信
Because I do.

192
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,667
你无处可逃
You can't hide from it.

193
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,070
	乔久 你在这里什么都不是
You're nothing here, Georgiou.

194
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,277
现在我给你一个机会
I'm giving you a chance to get back in.

195
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:00,247
参与这场跨越银河的行动
In on the action on a galactic scale.

196
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,682
别再逃避了
Stop running from it.

197
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,053
成为你本该成为的人
Be who you are.

198
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,004
或者就在这个酒吧待一辈子
Or stay and tend bar for eternity.

199
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,579
那就抓紧开始吧
Let's get on with it.

200
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,782
菲莉帕·乔久 认识一下我的团队
Philippa Georgiou, meet my team.

201
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,517
这是梅尔
This is Melle.

202
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,440
泽弗
Zeph.

203
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,291
你看起来像一把瑞士军刀
You look like a Swiss Army knife.

204
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,294
等等
Uh, hold on.

205
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,861
我不知道那是什么意思
I don't know what that means, but I'm not gonna

206
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,096
但我不可能傻站在这里被你侮辱
just stand here and get insulted.

207
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,664
我没说你
I'm not talking about you.

208
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,533
我是说你的装备
I'm talking about your suit.

209
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,636
鉴于你是新来的
Um, you're new,

210
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,705
所以我就解释这一回
so I'm gonna just explain this one time

211
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,880
当你在说装备
that when you are talking about the suit,

212
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,975
你就是在说我
you're talking about Zeph.

213
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,200
泽弗有点机械变形障碍症 大概
Zeph suffers from what we call mecha dysmorphia.

214
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,740
我也许不知道那是啥意思
And I may not know what that is,

215
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,520
但我也不接受
but I'm also not gonna take that from you, 

216
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,983
夸西 我觉得你冒犯了我
Quas, and personally I'm offended.

217
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,200
我觉得你应当知道 -这挺对的
- I think you should know... - Well, it's accurate.

218
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,540
你不能诊断我得了什么 你不是医生
It's not a diagnosis. You're not a doctor.

219
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,054
泽弗 泽弗 泽弗
Zeph. Zeph, Zeph!

220
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,580
-他知道 他知道 别吵了 -好吧
- He knows. He knows. He knows. - Okay, fine.

221
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,557
他知道
He knows.

222
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,758
-他明白的 他明白的 -是的
- He gets it. He gets it. - Yes.

223
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,294
行了 那位瓦肯人呢
Okay, what about that Vulcan?

224
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,763
没人跟她说吗
Nobody told her?

225
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,271
你说这个吗 正跟你说话的这个东西?
This? The thing you're talking to?

226
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:29,180
这个瓦肯外表不过是台机器
The Vulcan's just a machine.

227
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,003
我在里面
I'm inside.

228
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,039
操控它
Driving.

229
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:44,217
我通过体内的备用驾驶舱控制这具身体
I control the body from a backup vehicle.

230
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:47,018
这是我专门用来在狭窄空间里进出的小玩意
Yeah, something I use to get into tight spots.

231
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,187
你好啊
Hi there.

232
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,223
我是法兹
I'm Fuzz.

233
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,860
法兹是纳米人
Fuzz is a Nanokin.

234
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,580
一个天性爱玩的家伙
Real fun-loving guy.

235
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,100
你好
Hello.

236
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,420
除非他哪天不感兴趣了
Except for when he's not.

237
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,120
然后他就会变成一个易暴易怒的人了
Then he's deranged with an anger management problem.

238
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,135
你只说第一句就行了 夸西
Well, you could've stopped at the first thing, Quasi.

239
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:06,680
一个非法制造的瓦肯型运输载体
A bootleg Vulcan conveyance?

240
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,640
你肯定在黑市上见过不少了不得的东西
You must see cool stuff on the black market.

241
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,240
纳米人都是天生的拾荒者
Nanokins are pretty scavengery.

242
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,700
31区在废弃的船只上发现了虫害 
31 made first contact when we 

243
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,660
然后才有了第一次接触
discovered an infestation on a derelict ship.

244
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,300
夸西
Quasi.

245
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
啊 糟了
Oh, shit.

246
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,760
夸西 你再说一遍「虫害」试试看
Say "infestation" one more time, Quasi.

247
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,740
叫我「拾荒者」你这袋没形状的烟灰
Say "scavenger," you sack of amorphous soot!

248
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,440
我...我一顺口就说出来了
I-I s-- I heard it as soon as I said it.

249
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,560
我真想好好揍你一顿
I will kick your ass

250
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,840
直到你变成一团液体的…
until you cannot form a solid mass of...

251
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,760
法兹 情绪控制一下
Fuzz. Fuzz. Lock it down.

252
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,132
我已经够冷静了
I am locked down.

253
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,372
我被困在一个巨大的瓦肯机器脑袋里
I'm trapped inside a giant robot Vulcan head.

254
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,942
此刻没人比我更「冷静」了
No one is more locked down than me right now!

255
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,840
纳米人情绪光谱不太稳定
Nanokins have a wonky emotional spectrum.

256
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,200
不不不不行
No, no, no, no, no, no, 

257
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
不许用居高临下的态度对我 梅尔
I will not be condescended to, Melle,

258
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,449
尤其是你 因为说实话
particularly not by you, because honest...

259
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,820
我爱你 你就是一切
I love you. You are everything.

260
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:54,900
- 你喜欢我复杂的情绪光谱吗 - 法兹
- Does my spectrum work for you? - Fuzz.

261
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,823
- 我意思是 你是认真的吗 还是说…  -法兹
- I mean, like, like, are you into it or...  - Fuzz!

262
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:57,789
法兹
Fuzz!

263
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,292
她在侮辱你 朋友
She's insulting you, pal.

264
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,820
我就知道德尔塔人又会做他们德尔塔人的那一套
I know Deltans are gonna do their Deltan thing,

265
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,196
但是自尊自爱点吧 伙计
but have a little self-respect, would you?

266
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,363
能继续任务了吗
Can we continue?

267
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:07,140
然后这位是瑞秋·加勒特上尉
And that's Lieutenant Rachel Garrett.

268
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,400
她仅为这次任务被临时派往31区
She is detailed to Section 31 for this one mission only.

269
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,020
上尉 你得罪了谁才被派来这个秘密组织?
Who did you piss off to get stuck in black ops, Lieutenant?

270
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,840
派个星际舰队的人进来是确保我们行事合规
Starfleet is here to make sure we color inside the lines.

271
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,860
我参与本次行动的目的是保卫联邦
Starfleet is here to defend the Federation,

272
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,349
维持和平状态并确保不发生谋杀事件
keep the peace and make sure no one commits murder.

273
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,884
那你呢
And you?

274
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:25,380
等一下
One moment.

275
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,319
我认识夸西是因为
Quasi came on my radar

276
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,680
他证明了神经胶质细胞簇的存在
when he proved the existence of glioclusters.

277
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,759
神经胶质细胞簇只存在于理论中
Glioclusters are theoretical.

278
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,292
曾经是
Formerly theoretical.

279
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,063
生命充满无限可能
Life is just branching possibilities.

280
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,198
它们以你能想象的任何方式盛开
You know, they bloom and blossom any way you can imagine.

281
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:43,300
比如 我现在可能会被你吓倒
For example, I could be intimidated by you right now.

282
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,980
毕竟你杀了那么多人
I mean, after all, you've murdered so many people...

283
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,974
而且你好像能看透我的灵魂
and you seem to be staring right into my soul.

284
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,744
我可以对此做出回应
I could respond to that

285
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,960
或者我可以观察我的感受
or I could observe my feelings right now,

286
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,000
不管它 只做我需要做的事
lock it away and do what I need to do.

287
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,780
或者说
Or...

288
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,585
夸西 选一个好吗
Quas. Pick one. Hmm?

289
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:01,420
- 好吧 - 有时夸西能看到太多可能性
- Yes. - Sometimes Quasi sees so many options 

290
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,640
以至于他的思维可能会有所停滞
he gets brain-freeze.

291
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,480
多谢夸奖呢 梅尔
Thank you, Melle.

292
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,225
夸西 我们能继续了吗
Quasi, can we carry on, please?

293
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,560
我们的目标是达达·诺尔
Our target's name is Dada Noe.

294
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,996
一个有道德底线在哪都存疑的家伙
Dubious moral compass.

295
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,200
在他叛变之前 他在瓦特殖民地经营着一个病理学实验室
Ran a pathology lab on the Watt Colonies before he went rogue.

296
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,720
自那以后 他便开始替人定制生化武器
Since then, he's been designing bioweapons on spec.

297
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,340
诺尔前往巴拉姆空间站是为了
Noe's on his way to the Baraam 

298
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,760
把他的最新发明出手给米诺斯最高议会
to sell his latest creation to the Minosian High Council.

299
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,200
目前我们与米诺斯统治体之间并无正式敌对状态
There are no formal hostilities with the Minosian Sway,

300
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,240
但若他们拿到这件武器 
but that could change 

301
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,020
情况可能会发生变化
if they get their hands on a superweapon.

302
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,260
有任何关于这个超级生物武器的信息吗
Do we know what this bio superweapon is?

303
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,500
没有 但要是诺尔成功出售就坏了
No, but if Dada Noe is selling it, it's bad.

304
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,455
所以你的任务目标就是确保交易不会发生
So you're here to make sure the sale never happens.

305
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,931
怎么做
How?

306
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:41,600
你对我们行动的发觉确实造成了一些影响
Things went south when you spotted us,

307
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,800
但计划仍然可靠
but the plan is still solid.

308
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,760
首先 阿洛克会
First, Alok was going to...

309
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,635
你说吧
You can say it.

310
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,380
和你亲密接触
Connect. With you.

311
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,240
欢迎
Welcome!

312
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,200
这点子挺可爱
What a cute idea.

313
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,180
一旦我们适当的分散了你的注意力
Once we had you suitably distracted,

314
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,285
就轮到夸西做他擅长的事了
Quasi would do the other thing Quasi does.

315
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,880
好了 夸西
Okay, Quasi.

316
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
麻烦你了
If you would do the honors.

317
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,260
没问题
Absolutely.

318
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,299
我们开始吧
Let's get to work.

319
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,441
欢迎欢迎 达达·诺尔
Welcome, Dada Noe.

320
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,577
这时候法兹会参与进来
This is where Fuzz comes in.

321
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,818
你绝对想不到我能进入多小的地方
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

322
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:43,222
比如 身体改造组件的内部空间
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

323
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,858
只要我进入达达的身体改造组件里
Oh, once I fly inside Dada's body mod,

324
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,960
这就是我要发挥作用的时刻
well, then it's time to get to work.

325
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,600
这么多电路
So many circuits.

326
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,931
太多可能出错的东西了
So many things that could go wrong.

327
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,833
我们这位全副武装的十字军战士
Competency crusader here will talk me through

328
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,301
会通过植入物跟我交谈
the tech on the implant.

329
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,571
如果我认为我们通过达达·诺尔的植入物
And if I think we're putting Dada Noe's life in danger

330
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,280
让他生命垂危
by tinkering with that implant,

331
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,700
我会通过星际舰队
I will unleash the full weight of Starfleet

332
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,076
对此次任务施压
on this whole operation.

333
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:07,000
嘿 我们讨论的可是一个要出售超级武器的家伙
Oy, we're talking about a bloke who's selling superweapons

334
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,680
他会把东西卖给任何有拉蒂金卡的三流恐怖分子
to any third-rate terrorist with a Latinum card.

335
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,460
听仔细了 满脑子废品的家伙
Listen carefully, Junkyard.

336
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,480
星际舰队不执行暗杀任务
Starfleet does not do assassinations.

337
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,060
唉 别再满脑子的惦记着你的最高指导原则了
Ay, don't get your prime directives in a bunch.

338
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,220
不会让你亲自下场弄脏手的
You are not going to get your hands dirty

339
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,520
也不会坏了你升舰长的前程
and mess up your chances of becoming captain.

340
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,894
我可是顶尖科学官
I'm a top-tier science officer.

341
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,300
屁股拧成麻花了
Butt pretzel.

342
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,240
就是个死板精
Tight-ass.

343
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,680
真是太不尊重人了
So disrespectful.

344
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,867
只要加勒特和法兹切断了组件的链接
Soon as Garrett and Fuzz sever that link...

345
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,180
他就随便我们拿捏了
...he'll be under our control, 

346
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,040
我会和泽弗一起制服他
and I'll take him down with the help of Zeph.

347
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,800
一下搞定
That's what I call a hit.

348
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,320
只需一下
One.

349
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,216
达达·诺尔会被拘留 他的病原体会被没收
Dada Noe and his pathogen will be in custody

350
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,054
这一切会在卖家出现在巴拉姆空间站之前就完成
before the buyers can even show up to the Baraam.

351
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,100
速战速决
And we are in and out.

352
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,360
呃
Mm.

353
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,900
算了
Meh.

354
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,294
啥
Meh?

355
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,540
我有个更简单的办法
I have a simpler idea.

356
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,600
表情很绝望 我看的出来
♪ Desperate, I can tell ♪

357
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,802
所有的祈求
♪ All that begging ♪

358
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,837
都像是为你量身定做的
♪ Suits you well. ♪

359
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,706
现在打爆我的手机
♪ Blowing up my phone now ♪

360
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,809
我向上 你低头
♪ Going up, you bow down ♪

361
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,377
看看是谁需要谁
♪ Look at who needs who... ♪

362
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:15,114
欢迎欢迎 达达·诺尔先生
Welcome, Monsieur Dada Noe.

363
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,460
您的到来使巴拉姆空间站蓬荜生辉
We're honored to have you here at the Baraam.

364
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,940
我是维罗妮卡·杜·弗朗克 这里的店主
I am Veronique du Franc, the proprietor.

365
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,920
我早就预约我的套间了吧
I told them to have my suite ready.

366
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,160
当然 先生
Mais oui, monsieur.

367
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,224
请允许我带您到房间里
May I escort you to your quarters?

368
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,660
请随我来
Come.

369
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,997
我们有最好的…
We have the most exquisite...

370
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:33,020
我简直不敢相信你会信任这个反社会的疯子
I can't believe you're trusting this sociopath.

371
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,880
上尉
Well, Lieutenant,

372
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,400
你做好自己的事
you got to do what you got to do,

373
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:36,780
我知道怎么跟反社会疯子打交道
and I'm kind of familiar with sociopaths.

374
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,838
我说了别带我来
I said don't bring me.

375
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,475
我想您的旅程一切顺利 先生
I trust your trip was without incident, monsieur.

376
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,860
你的团队倒是帮我把一切都打点好了
Well, your people made everything easy.

377
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,160
不胜荣幸
Our pleasure.

378
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,320
我们到了
Here we are.

379
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,280
太俗气了
So tacky.

380
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,727
但我想这就是你出名的地方
But I guess that's what you're known for.

381
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:06,999
这是什么？
What's this?

382
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,367
这东西叫相位转移器
It's called a phase pod.

383
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,003
我的某位客户送给我的礼物
A client of mine gave it to me as a gift,

384
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,438
我自己也有一个
and I got one for myself, too.

385
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,684
你在做什么
What are you doing?

386
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,352
宇宙中的一切
Everything in the universe vibrates

387
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:27,953
都以特定的波长振动
on a certain wavelength.

388
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,355
该死
Damn it.

389
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:32,859
把箱子还给我
Give me back my case.

390
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,360
我拒绝
No.

391
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:38,463
维修费从你的押金里出
That's coming out of your security deposit.

392
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,367
相位转移器则会改变
The phase pod changes the wavelength

393
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,069
接触到的任何东西的物质波长
of whatever they touch.

394
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,305
我和你不在同一相位 你也不和我在同一相位
I am out of phase with you, and you're out of phase with me.

395
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:50,509
但是我 跟你的箱子在同一相位
I am, however, in phase with your case.

396
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,214
然后我会把它拿走
And I will be taking it with me.

397
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:59,118
你根本不知道你挑起了什么
You have no idea what you've started.

398
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,989
哎呀
Whoopsie.

399
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,861
印象深刻
Impressive.

400
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,463
你确定你是人类？
Are you sure you're human?

401
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,599
多数时候是
Most days.

402
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,234
谢谢你
Thank you.

403
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:50,970
把箱子给我
Give me the case.

404
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,336
你是谁
Who are you?

405
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,282
他从那儿走了 那儿那儿 那边
He went that way. That way, that way, that way, that way!

406
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,829
哦 外星人
Oh, aliens.

407
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:51,429
-裸体外星人 -泽弗 快走
- Naked aliens. - Go, Zeph, go.

408
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:13,685
他往休息室去了 天哪 他们走得真快
He's headed to the lounge. Man, they're moving fast.

409
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,453
梅尔 他朝你来了
Melle, he's coming to you.

410
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,191
哎呀
Yikes.

411
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:29,968
没事没事
No, it's okay.

412
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,537
-我没事 -梅尔 你看到他了吗？
- I'm all right. - Melle, you got him?

413
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,739
看到了
Got him.

414
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:36,876
哎呀
Ooh-la-la!

415
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,610
嗨 亲爱的
Ay, amor.

416
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,342
不可能
That's not possible.

417
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,877
它已经被我销毁了
I had that destroyed.

418
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:54,145
不 不
No. No!

419
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,649
这不可能
It's not possible.

420
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,185
你知道那件武器
You knew that weapon.

421
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:01,253
是什么武器
What is it?

422
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,723
那是什么武器
What is it?

423
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:09,595
好吧 那就来硬的
Fine. The hard way.

424
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,396
永恒的祈求者恳请觐见
The Eternal Supplicant begs approach.

425
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,765
准了
You have my permission.

426
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,575
向女王陛下致敬
All hail Her Most Imperial Majesty,

427
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:57,909
祖国之母
Mother of the Fatherland,

428
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,079
-瓦肯的君主 -这是什么
- Overlord of Vulc-- - What is it?

429
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,082
它完成了 陛下
It is finished, Your Majesty.

430
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:07,786
我的工程师们在哪
Where are my engineers?

431
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:13,692
他们 他们在完工后结束了自己的生命
They... they took their own lives upon completion.

432
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,300
你在为谁流泪 桑
Who is the tear for, San?

433
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,271
说
Speak.

434
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:28,474
是为您 陛下
It is for you, Majesty.

435
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,510
这都是
It is all...

436
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,314
为了您
...for you.

437
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,992
我再问你 桑
I asked you a question, San.

438
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,462
你为何为我而哭
Why do you cry for me?

439
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,801
看着我
Look at me.

440
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:03,475
你还记得我们是谁吗
Do you remember who we were?

441
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:06,645
在这一切之前
Before all this.

442
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:09,580
好奇的男孩
The curious boy.

443
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,351
天真的女孩
The innocent girl.

444
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:15,587
我只记得我的失败 陛下
I only remember my failure, Majesty.

445
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,657
别对我撒谎
Don't lie to me.

446
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:26,931
我们是唯一能理解活着的代价的人
We were the only ones who could understand the cost to stay alive.

447
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,668
我们是一个集体
We made a team.

448
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:33,172
我们彼此需要 不是吗
We needed each other, didn't we?

449
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:39,310
我们说过什么 携手共同生存下去
What did we say to carry each other through,to survive together?

450
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,147
我们虽为两人
We are two...

451
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,550
但为一体
But one.

452
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,186
我们虽为两人 但为一体
We are two but one.

453
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,355
如果我说
If I said then,

454
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:50,856
”我们逃跑吧
"Let's run away,

455
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,391
让我们逃离这场竞争
"let's flee this competition

456
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,660
以及把我们和人族联系在一起的一切“
and everything that binds us to Terra,"

457
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,029
你会说
什么what would you have said?

458
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,404
您问这个问题的时机比您认为的更具诗意
The timing of your question is more poetic than you know.

459
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,776
我会说 好
I would have said yes.

460
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,050
当时
Then.

461
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,821
那么现在呢
But now?

462
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:29,228
您本可以在您治下创造一些美丽的东西
You could have made something beautiful with your reign.

463
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:31,963
但是 您却选择了创造这个
Instead, you chose to build this.

464
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,999
这意味着我认识的那个天真的女孩
That means that innocent girl I knew,

465
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,569
她已经
she has been...

466
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,471
被谋杀了
...murdered.

467
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:42,608
怎么回事
What is this?

468
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,543
你
You...

469
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:48,380
你服用了一样的毒药？
You took the same poison?

470
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,551
不 我不许你死
No! I forbid you to die!

471
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,587
没有人愿意活在
No one wants to live

472
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:59,124
您的世界中 皇帝
in your world, Emperor.

473
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:02,294
你是个怪物
You are a monster!

474
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:32,924
这是什么令人愉快的地方
And what delightful place is this?

475
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,326
一个安全屋
A safe house.

476
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:37,228
但对你而言也许不是
But maybe not so safe for you.

477
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:38,630
你是31区的
You are Section 31.

478
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,301
你为什么不拷问我以获取答案
Why aren't you torturing answers out of me?

479
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,635
你是个暴君
You're a tyrant.

480
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,003
货真价实的
A real one.

481
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,505
折磨你不会有什么用的
Torture wouldn't work.

482
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,940
你怎么会这么了解我这种人
How do you know so much about people like me?

483
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:55,647
你在某个地方精神体验到了暴政 而且很体验的深刻
You learned tyranny somewhere, and you learned hard.

484
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:59,017
如果你必须要隐藏这点的话 这是个弱点
If you have to hide it, that's a weakness.

485
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:04,088
而且我不能有这样的搭档
And I can't have that in a partner.

486
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,325
-我们不是搭档 -不是？
- We're not partners. - No?

487
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:08,226
我可帮了大忙了
I've been very helpful.

488
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,028
你的计划行不通
You had a plan that couldn't work.

489
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,330
而我给了你更好的
I gave you a better one.

490
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,799
你让我尝到了甜头
You gave me a taste of the action,

491
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,701
知道我还想要更多
knowing I'd want more.

492
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,837
你需要我
You need me.

493
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,206
你选择了我
You chose me.

494
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,276
为什么呢
Why?

495
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,545
不管你认为你的任务是什么
Whatever you believed your mission was,

496
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,614
这远比你想象的更糟糕
it's worse than you thought.

497
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:33,084
数十亿人的生命危在旦夕 且时间紧迫
Billions of lives are at stake, and time is short.

498
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:37,088
你先让我了解你 我才能告诉你
Tell me you, and I will tell you me.

499
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:43,795
唯一可行的办法就是让我知道我在和谁打交道
The only way this works is if I know exactly who I'm dealing with.

500
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,609
我也不属于这个时代
I'm not from this time, either.

501
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,079
我出生于地球 20世纪
I was born on Earth, 20th century.

502
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:04,650
你已经350岁了
You are 350 years old?

503
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,051
差不多
More or less.

504
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,587
大部分时间我是睡过去的
I slept most of that time.

505
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:11,557
在我被流放之后
After my exile.

506
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,562
优生战争
The Eugenics Wars.

507
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:22,734
强化人
Augments...

508
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:24,470
夺走了我的星球
took my planet.

509
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:27,773
我的家乡
My home.

510
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,147
我们大概有十个人参加了战争
There was maybe ten of us who fought.

511
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,718
我认识的人不是挨了一枪就是挨了一刀
Everyone I knew either took a bullet or a blade.

512
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,953
我也还以颜色
But I gave some back.

513
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,457
这让她注意到了我
She noticed me.

514
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:49,860
那个屠杀我家人的强化人
The Augment who slaughtered my family.

515
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:54,933
他们叫她被标记的吉里
They called her Giri the Marked.

516
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,901
她收留了我
She took me in.

517
00:38:56,902 --> 00:39:00,105
让我比任何人类都强大
Made me stronger than any human should be.

518
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:01,640
她把我撕成碎片
She ripped me apart

519
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:05,242
然后把我重塑成了她军队里的又一个强化人
and turned me into another Augment for her army.

520
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:08,346
我做了很多可怕的事
And I did terrible things.

521
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:12,751
都是为了像你这样的怪物
All for a monster like you.

522
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:19,124
因为对于暴君来说 永远只有一个选择
Because for tyrants, there is only one choice:

523
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,560
杀戮
murder.

524
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,163
你还没杀我
You haven't killed me.

525
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:27,633
暂时还没
Yet.

526
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:38,710
我能认出那个武器是因为我下令造了它
I recognized the weapon because I ordered it to be built.

527
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,481
召集你的人手
Gather your people.

528
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:45,150
我们将需要他们每个人
We're gonna need every one of them.

529
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,523
在我的宇宙里 总有阴谋家存在
In my universe, there were always plotters.

530
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,191
总有政变
Always a coup.

531
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:30,361
所以我造了一件武器来终结所有威胁
So I built a weapon to end all threats.

532
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:34,199
我称之为天赐之物
I called it the Godsend.

533
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,902
它会引发一种连锁反应
It triggers a chain reaction,

534
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:39,538
就像病毒一样在群星间传播
like a virus passing between planets.

535
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:42,306
所到之处 一切都将化为灰烬
Everything in its path incinerates.

536
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:44,876
整个象限都会消失
An entire quadrant would be lost.

537
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,245
如果我的敌人设法杀了我
If my enemies managed to kill me,

538
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,448
他们就没有什么可统治的了
there would be nothing left to rule.

539
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,219
有个小问题
Yeah, hi. Quick question.

540
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,587
对不起
Sorry.

541
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,556
就一个很小很小的问题
Yeah, no. Uh, just a qu-- it's just a quick one.

542
00:40:57,656 --> 00:41:01,259
这是天赐之物还是天赐之暮
Is it Godsend or God's End?

543
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,261
天赐之物还是天赐之暮
Godsend or God's End?

544
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,662
我不明白你说的有什么区别
I don't hear a difference in what you're saying.

545
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:08,099
真的？真的？天赐之 物 天赐之 暮
Really? Really? Godsend. God's End.

546
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,368
-我还是没明白 -天赐之物是
- Yeah, I'm still not getting it. - The Godsend is...

547
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,836
等等 天赐之物 我现在听清楚了
Wait, Godsend. I hear it now.

548
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,772
-天赐之物 不是暮 -物
- It's Godsend. No apostrophe. - Send.

549
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,440
天赐之物现在就在这里
The Godsend is here.

550
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,743
怎么来的 那可是另一个宇宙
How? It's from another universe.

551
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,510
我不知道 但是那个人现在持有它
I don't know, but that man had it.

552
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,312
你以为是达达·诺伊的那个人
The one that you think is Dada Noe.

553
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,248
我们都知道是达达·诺伊的那个人
The one we know is Dada Noe.

554
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,383
不 他不是你们的达达·诺伊 不可能是
No, he's not your Dada Noe. He can't be.

555
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,353
他来自人族帝国 是他把天赐之物带来这里
He's from the Terran Empire, and he brought the Godsend here.

556
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:32,658
只有这样他才会知道那是什么
That's the only way he can know about it.

557
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:34,159
一旦我们把他关得严严实实
And since we have him locked up tight,

558
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:35,961
-我要亲自审讯他 -不 不 不
- I'll interrogate him. -No, no, no.

559
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,362
-我们不能相信这个女人说的话 -是啊
- We cannot trust a single word this woman says. - Yeah.

560
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:39,865
她害我们失去了梅尔
She cost us Melle.

561
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,800
只有她知道我们面对的是什么人
She's the only one who knows what we're dealing with.

562
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,769
是啊 她是这么说的 小兄弟
Yeah, well, so she says, little bro.

563
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,203
小？
Little?

564
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:46,905
这是身材羞辱
Scale-shamer!

565
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,640
微生物比恐龙更长寿
Microbes outlasted dinosaurs!

566
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,308
冷静点 我要说的是
Calm your boots. What I'm saying is...

567
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,711
我要尿在你的装甲上 直到你全身生锈
I will piss in your suit until you go all rusty like!

568
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,380
这一切都是她搞砸的
...that she's the reason this is all bollixed up.

569
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,348
她是梅尔死的原因 她也是
She's the reason Melle's dead, and she's the reason

570
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,650
我们现在在银河系尽头的原因
we're in the ass end of the galaxy.

571
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,018
听着
Listen up.

572
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:04,790
乔久和我回船上去
Georgiou and I are gonna go back to the ship.

573
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:08,225
达达·诺伊是我们与天赐之物的唯一联系
Dada Noe is our only link to the Godsend,

574
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,329
所以我们要找他谈谈
so we're gonna have a little chat with him.

575
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,010
什么
What?

576
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,077
她叫菲利帕·乔久
Her name is Philippa Georgiou,

577
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,847
女王陛下
Her Most Imperial Majesty.

578
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,748
祖国之母
Mother of the Fatherland.

579
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:32,050
瓦肯的君王
Overlord of Vulcan.

580
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,519
克罗诺斯的主宰 安多利亚的女王
Dominus of Qo'noS, Regina Andor,

581
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,088
菲利帕·乔久·奥古斯都·伊波尼亚斯·塞塔瑞斯
Philippa Georgiou Augustus Iaponius Centarius.

582
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,190
酷
Cool.

583
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:40,491
配薯条的吗
That come with fries?

584
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:42,927
很好笑 对吧
That was good, right?

585
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,164
好吧
Okay.

586
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:49,133
每次你不直接回答她的问题
Every time you don't answer her questions directly,

587
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:52,270
女王陛下就会狠狠地打你的脸
Her Majesty will punch you in your face.

588
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,239
好吧
Fine.

589
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:56,141
我是达达
I'm Dada.

590
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,308
达达·诺伊 先念达达 再是诺伊
Dada Noe. Just Dada, then Noe.

591
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,711
就是这样 没有中间
That's it. No in-betweens.

592
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:02,112
然后 我
And I, uh...

593
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:06,517
我以前在瓦特殖民地开过一家病理学实验室
I used to run a pathology lab in the Watt Colonies.

594
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,791
搞什么鬼
What the shit, man?!

595
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:16,895
你说是她会打脸的
You said that she was gonna be doing the face punching!

596
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:20,431
现在我俩都说谎了 你不是那个达达
So now we both have lied. You are not that Dada.

597
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:24,235
你是那些人口中说的他的镜像版本
You're what these people call his Mirror.

598
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:28,039
你来自人族帝国
You came here from the Terran Empire,

599
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,474
然后你带来了天赐之物
and you brought the Godsend.

600
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,210
什么天赐之物
What's the Godsend?

601
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,947
我自己的军事委员会试图废黜我
My own war council tried to depose me.

602
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:39,250
你知道我是怎么说服元帅开口的吗
Do you know how I convinced the field marshal to talk?

603
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,327
我曾是个管理员
I was an administrator

604
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,229
在地球上的帝国武器设施工作
at an Imperial weapons facility on Terra.

605
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:52,597
是的
Uh, yeah.

606
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:56,234
天赐之物被存放在我管理的设施中
The Godsend was stored at my facility.

607
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:01,038
大多数人认为这只是一个传说 但我知道这是真的
Most thought it was a legend, but I knew it was real.

608
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:02,741
所以你想卖掉它
So you tried to sell it.

609
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,174
是 是的
Yeah, yeah.

610
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:07,779
我想靠得来的收益安静地生活在这里
I wanted to live here quietly on its proceeds.

611
00:44:07,913 --> 00:44:09,580
你是怎么来到我们的宇宙的
How did you get to our universe?

612
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:15,553
有一个离子风暴
There was an ion storm.

613
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,588
实际上是两个
Two of them, actually.

614
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:20,125
当它们汇合时 就像时钟的钟摆一样
And when they converged, which they do like clockwork,

615
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:23,393
它们在帝国的边缘撕开了什么东西
they ripped something open on the fringes of the Empire--

616
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:28,099
他们称之为 一个异像 但这实际上是一条通道
an anomaly, they called it-- but it was a passageway

617
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,136
从人族帝国通往这里
to get to this place from the Terran Empire.

618
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:36,307
从你们的新月星云穿出
Comes out through your Crescent Nebula.

619
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,609
很少有人知道 至少现在是
Few know about it. For now.

620
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,479
但它四小时后会重新开放
But it'll open again in four hours.

621
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,149
那是我要去见买家的时间
That's when I was supposed to be meeting my buyer.

622
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:46,084
你知道那武器的作用吗
Are you aware of what that weapon does?

623
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,619
人族帝国已经快耗尽了资源
The Terran Empire's burned through its resources.

624
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,855
物资严重匮乏
There's famine.

625
00:44:49,955 --> 00:44:52,523
整个生态系统正在崩溃
Entire ecologies are collapsing.

626
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,925
他们需要寻找新的土地
They need to find a new territory

627
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:56,661
来征服以及压榨
to conquer and strip-mine.

628
00:44:56,795 --> 00:44:59,229
当他们意识到他们的超级武器不见了
When they realize that their superweapon is gone,

629
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,966
他们会找到那个通道--
they're gonna find that passageway--

630
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,667
你知道他们会的 而且他们会过来
you know they will-- and they'll come

631
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:06,304
烧光所有他们接触过的东西 奴役活着的人
and they'll burn everything they touch and enslave the rest,

632
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:09,507
因为你的帝国就是这么做的 “陛下”
because that's what the Empire does, Majesty.

633
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:13,178
他们把你的套路都学会了
They learned well from you.

634
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:16,446
还有谁想要它？
Who else wants it?

635
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,549
我不知道 伙计
I-I don't know, man.

636
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,919
我收到了一个报价 钱是真的
I got an offer. The money was real.

637
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:23,154
有人偷走了我们的神之使（神之死）
Someone stole the Godsend from us.

638
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:25,255
- 谁？- 不知道
- Who was he? - No idea.

639
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:28,626
无论谁闯入我的地盘 无论谁偷了那件武器
Whoever broke into my room, whoever stole that weapon,

640
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,495
他们知道些东西 因为得到了
they know what they know because they learned it

641
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:32,163
你们中的某一个人提供的情报
from one of you.

642
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:54,452
紧急传送
Emergency transporter.

643
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:30,221
这可真棒
Well, this is great.

644
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:32,590
更棒了
Oh, even better.

645
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,960
那是飞船吗？船没了？
Is that... is that the ship? Is the ship gone?

646
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,261
我还挺喜欢那艘船的
I liked that ship.

647
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:38,096
发生什么事了？
What happened?

648
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:39,931
被破坏了
Sabotage.

649
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:44,534
什么？
What?

650
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,105
偷走神之使（神之死）的人有一个同伙
Whoever stole the Godsend had a partner.

651
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,607
在我们几个之中
It was someone here.

652
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:53,979
这意味着我们中的一个是内鬼
Which means one of us is a mole.

653
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:01,752
- 可能是你 - 可能是你
- Could be you. - Could be you.

654
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:03,187
如果是我
If it were me,

655
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:05,423
我早把你们都杀了
I would have murdered all of you already.

656
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:07,893
听着 老大 如果有内鬼 你应该知道不是我
Look, boss, if there's a mole, you know it's not me.

657
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:09,894
虽然我这话自己听起来也很像内奸
I mean, that sounds pretty moley to me.

658
00:47:09,895 --> 00:47:11,462
我也迷糊了
I don't know.

659
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,231
我们已经一起执行了大约十次行动
We've been on like ten ops together.

660
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,033
是 但我仍然不知道你长什么样 对吧？
Yeah, and I still don't even know what you look like, do I?

661
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,935
没有人知道02长什么样子
No one knows what a Chameloid looks like.

662
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:19,904
- 你可以变成任何你想要的东西 - 法兹呢？
- You might change into anything you want. - What about Fuzz, huh?

663
00:47:19,905 --> 00:47:21,940
- 他的体型与其他人都不在一个尺度上 - 转移注意力？
- He exists on a whole other scale than anybody else. - Mm, deflecting?

664
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:25,409
我的妻子即将产下我们的第一窝卵囊
My wife is about to lay our first litter of egg sacs.

665
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,579
我还有19万只幼崽正在路上……
- No, I have 190,000 hatchlings on the way... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

666
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,247
- ...我希望他们活下去 - 好吧 听着
- ...and I want them to live. - Well, look,

667
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:31,748
你可以在我们中的任何人找到动机
you could find a motive for any of us.

668
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,485
也可能是你们中任何两个的组合
Or it could be a combination of any of you.

669
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,454
你知道 就像泽夫和法兹或者.
You know, like-like Zeph and-and Fuzz or...

670
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,055
你漏掉了梅勒
You are spinning out without Melle.

671
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:39,724
你无法做出选择
You cannot land on a choice.

672
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:41,859
也许你试图往我脑子里灌输这个观点 是因为你是内鬼
Maybe you're putting that in my head because you're the mole.

673
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,461
会不会是加勒特？她是新来的
Huh? How about Garrett? She's new.

674
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:44,662
她不在乎我们
She doesn't care about us.

675
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,197
我是星际舰队
I'm Starfleet.

676
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:49,900
还有没有人像我一样感受到一阵英雄主义的风
Whoa. Anyone else feel that heroic breeze right there

677
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,302
弄乱了她的斗篷？
ruffling her cape?

678
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:53,604
好吧 那里有一艘旧船
Okay, there's an old ship out there,

679
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,940
一艘旧垃圾驳船
an old garbage scow.

680
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,641
是的 我发现它的时候你在上面
Yeah, I found it when you were up there

681
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:58,242
审问金属脑袋
interrogating metal head.

682
00:47:58,243 --> 00:47:59,744
一定已经很多年没有人驾驶过它了
Must be years since anyone flew it,

683
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:01,112
但我认为我们可以修复它
but I think we can work with it

684
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,814
追捕拿走神之使（神之死）的人
to go after whoever took the Godsend.

685
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:06,283
我没那么不喜欢你了
Mm. I dislike you less.

686
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:09,320
如果我想有人喜欢我 我就会养一只狗
If I wanted someone to like me, I'd get a dog.

687
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:10,587
我喜欢秩序
I like order.

688
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:13,024
我喜欢预测和结论
I like prediction and conclusion.

689
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:17,261
那你就选错了团队 因为我们面对的是 内鬼
Then you're on the wrong team because we've got mole,

690
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:19,430
被困在一颗死去的星球
stranded on a dead planet,

691
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,132
与外界没有沟通方式
no communication with the outside,

692
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,003
以及不到四个小时之后人族将得到神之使（神之死）
and less than four hours before the Terrans get the Godsend

693
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:27,005
并在银河系的任何地方使用它
and use it anywhere in the galaxy.

694
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:30,841
说到这里 夸西 天线阵列怎么样了？
Speaking of which, Quas, what about the antenna array?

695
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:34,012
这个嘛...
Uh, well...

696
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,048
嗯 它已经过时了几十年了
Well, it's a couple decades out of date.

697
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:40,284
我们修复它 告诉31区即将发生的事情
We get it up and running, then we tell 31 what's coming.

698
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:41,552
我们一起工作
We work together.

699
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:43,754
- 每个人都不要离开视线 - 好的
- Everyone stays in sight. - Yeah.

700
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,723
只是...
Just...

701
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:51,229
走吧
Let's go.

702
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:07,478
那个想法泡汤了
Well, there goes that idea.

703
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:10,815
我们的小内鬼真的很忙
Our little mole has been really busy.

704
00:49:10,915 --> 00:49:12,516
扯断了所有线路
Ripped up all the wiring.

705
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:14,385
分两个队 我会带一个进入树林
Two teams. I'll lead one into the woods.

706
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,754
三个人 看看我们是否能挽救那艘小艇
Three to see if we can salvage that scow.

707
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,089
你和其他人一起留在这里
You stay here with the others

708
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:19,656
并尝试修复天线阵列
and try and fix the antenna array.

709
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:21,892
为什么她现在在对我们发号施令？
Why is she giving us orders now?

710
00:49:22,027 --> 00:49:23,360
因为我让她发号施令的
Because I'm letting her

711
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:25,063
我很确定她不是内奸
and I'm pretty certain she's not the mole.

712
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:26,797
你不会把赌注押在一匹名叫“很确定”的马上
You wouldn't bet on a horse named Pretty Certain.

713
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:30,835
夸西、法兹 你们马上和乔久一起去船
Quas, Fuzz, you get to the scow right away with Georgiou.

714
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:32,603
泽夫和加勒特 你们跟我待在这
Zeph and Garrett, you stay here with me.

715
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:34,205
我们会搞定天线阵列的
We'll take care of the antenna array.

716
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,107
请解释一下
Uh, I'm sorry.

717
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,642
我是应该出去
I'm supposed to go out into the woods

718
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:39,344
和两个想杀我的人一起进入树林？
with two people who want to kill me?

719
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:41,679
保持在彼此的视线之内 别死了就行
Just stay in sight of each other and don't get dead.

720
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:43,081
好吗？
Okay?

721
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:44,849
好吧 谢谢 队长
Yep, thanks, Cap.

722
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:46,883
我的意思是 50%的概率 他们中的一个人想杀我
I mean, just fifty-fifty shot one of them wants to kill me,

723
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:49,220
- 然后是25%的... - 夸西 赶紧出去吧
- and then 25%... - Quas, just get your ass out there.

724
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,455
我也爱你 队长
I love you, too, Cap.

725
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:52,423
一切就绪 遵命
- All righty. - Aye, aye.

726
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,935
这艘旧船上的内部电路
The internal circuitry on this old scow

727
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,305
状态仍然不错
is still in decent shape.

728
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:12,643
-我看到的一切都应该能用
- Everything I'm seeing should work.

729
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:17,815
所以我们正在追的东西 神之使（神之死）
So this thing we're chasing, the Godsend,

730
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,951
你的工程师 他们安装保险没有？
your engineers, did they install a fail-safe?

731
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:23,121
我们可以远程禁用它吗？
Can we disable it remotely?

732
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:28,393
没有这种保险 我不会允许的
There is no fail-safe. I wouldn't allow it.

733
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:30,695
不愧是你
How very on-brand for you.

734
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:32,096
我可以再问你一个问题吗？
Can I ask you one more question?

735
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:34,264
我就只再问你一个问题
I'm just gonna ask you one more question.

736
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:36,801
所以你把神之使带到了这个世界上
So you brought the Godsend into the world

737
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:40,004
是为了蒸发数万亿生命
to vaporize quadrillions of lives.

738
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:43,908
就从来没有想过这有点 太过火了？
Never thought that was a little, you know, much?

739
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,612
我下令销毁它
I ordered it destroyed.

740
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:52,782
有人把它藏起来了 你自己的人背叛了你
And someone hid it. Your own people betrayed you.

741
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,153
你们的企业文化就是彻头彻尾的狗屎
Well, your corporate culture was straight-up shit.

742
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:57,388
而且你没有回答我的问题
And you didn't answer my question.

743
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:59,857
线圈没了
The asymptote coil is gone.

744
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:04,061
一定是有人把它拾走了
Someone must have scavenged it for the terbium.

745
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:07,098
好吧 再找一个 这个东西应该能飞
Well, find another one, this thing should fly.

746
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:09,599
- 也许是货箱 - 别 别
- Maybe the cargo hull. - Huh. Oh, no, no.

747
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,437
每个人都待在一起 好吗？
Everyone stays together, all right?

748
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:15,273
降低你杀死我们的可能性
Limits the possibilities of you killing us.

749
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,109
我们去货舱吧
Let's go to the cargo hold, please.

750
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,911
你不来吗？
Aren't you coming?

751
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,881
来 我可太高兴了
Yes. I couldn't be more excited.

752
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:29,154
当然 我可以在那里帮助你
Yeah, I could help you down there, of course,

753
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:31,522
但考虑到 控制
but considering how, you know, control

754
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,524
是你整个身份的核心
is central to your entire identity

755
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:35,526
而事实上我不擅长控制
and the fact that I'm just not good at it,

756
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,062
我就站在这里 为了我们的关系
I'm just gonna stand here and honor our relationship

757
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:40,464
- 什么也不做 - 还真热心呢
- by doing absolutely nothing. - Helpful.

758
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:42,166
这被称为激进的自我接受
It's called radical self-acceptance.

759
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:43,668
- 从你身上演进而来 - 谢谢你
- Evolved of you. - Well, thank you.

760
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,236
所以说 你能修好它吗？
So, can you fix it?

761
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:49,207
我甚至不确定它是否坏了 只是少了个零件罢了
I'm not even sure it's broken. It's just missing a part.

762
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:51,508
看 这个--这根撕裂的电线看起来很戏剧性
Look, this-this torn wiring looks dramatic,

763
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:53,411
但该设备内置了冗余
but this equipment has redundancy built in.

764
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:54,912
有一个简单的解决办法
There's an easy work-around.

765
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:58,515
唯一问题是 有人取出了θ节点
Except somebody ripped out the theta junction.

766
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:00,285
除此之外 这个东西应该可以用
Other than that, this thing should work.

767
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:03,388
好吧 也许我们的内鬼得到了它
Okay, well, maybe our mole has it.

768
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,461
- 加勒特？- 咋了
- Garrett? - Yeah.

769
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,729
泽夫
Zeph.

770
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:13,798
泽夫在哪里？
Where is Zeph?

771
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:23,308
泽夫 进来
Zeph, come in.

772
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:26,411
泽夫 你收到吗？
Zeph, do you copy?

773
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:35,920
泽夫
Zeph.

774
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:44,862
加勒特 是你吗？
Garrett, was that you?

775
00:52:48,433 --> 00:52:50,401
加勒特 那到底是什么？
Garrett, what the hell was that?

776
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,437
有人刚刚激活了天线阵列
Someone just activated the antenna array.

777
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:54,404
该死
Damn it.

778
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:56,774
发生了什么？
What's happening?

779
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:59,277
加勒特 情况简报
Garrett, sitrep.

780
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,612
越来越棒了
This is going to be good.

781
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:04,582
中尉 收到了吗？完毕
Lieutenant, do you copy? Over.

782
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:13,791
安全
Clear.

783
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,394
安全
Clear.

784
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:17,894
这里什么都没有
Nothing here.

785
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:20,431
怎么会有人用这个来发出信号呢？
How could someone have used this to send out a signal?

786
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,633
不可能 它少了一个部件
Impossible. It's missing a part.

787
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:25,002
有人把它打成了筛子
And someone shot it to hell.

788
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,104
我听到有人在跑
I heard someone running.

789
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,006
泽夫一定是把θ节点放回去了
Zeph must have put the theta junction back in.

790
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:31,442
使用阵列后 射击阵列
Then shot it after he used the array.

791
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,315
所以他一定是在擅离职守后绕回来的
So he must have circled back after he went AWOL.

792
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:41,652
泽夫来这个星球来阻碍我们
Zeph came down to this planet to sabotage us.

793
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:43,521
现在我们被困住了
And now that we're stranded,

794
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,156
他给同谋发了信息
he sent a message to whoever he's working with.

795
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,158
他会潜伏直到撤离的船抵达
And he'll lay low until his ride gets here,

796
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:49,927
然后逃之夭夭
and then he's long gone.

797
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:52,497
那我们得先找到他
Then we need to find him first.

798
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:02,138
观察者 收到吗？
Observer, do you copy?

799
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:04,808
拜托 突袭者一号 我什么时候收不到？
Please, Raider One, when do I not copy?

800
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,011
真好笑 情况如何？
That's funny. Status?

801
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:10,614
我收到了很多干扰
I'm picking up a lot of interference,

802
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:12,383
但三录仪显示 泽夫的生命信号
but the tricorder shows Zeph's biosignature

803
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:14,719
就在这个区域 完毕
was just in this sector. Over.

804
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,723
收到 全体都有 保持低调 保持队形
Copy. Stay low and tight, people.

805
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:25,663
你服务的那个军阀 吉里 她怎么了？
The warlord you served, Giri, what happened to her?

806
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,732
她死了 死于生前最爱的事
She died like she lived.

807
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:29,867
你知道我说的什么
By that, you know what I mean.

808
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,167
她很幸运
She was lucky.

809
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:33,237
她并没染上良心这种东西
She wasn't infected with a conscience.

810
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:34,672
染？-是的
- Infected? - Yeah.

811
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,907
怪物只能是怪物
A monster can only be a monster.

812
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:40,176
一个会悔恨的怪物是没用的
A monster with regrets is useless.

813
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:41,746
嗯 所以这就是你躲起来的原因
Mm. So that's why you were hiding

814
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:43,581
在一个不毛之地的酒吧
in a bar at the ass end of nowhere.

815
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:46,016
也许这就是你和31区的人合作的原因
Maybe it's why you're working with 31.

816
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,752
把你的前科抹掉
To wipe your slate clean.

817
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:50,321
像我们这样的人总是要付出代价的
There's always a price to pay for people like us.

818
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:52,323
如果你不同意 你就不会在这里
You wouldn't be here if you didn't agree.

819
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:54,190
所以这就是你选择我的原因
Oh, so that's why you chose me.

820
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:56,894
你认为我是一个有足够感情的怪物 可以被控制
You think I'm a monster who feels enough to be controlled

821
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:58,729
但仍在做真正肮脏的工作
but still do the real dirty work.

822
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:01,165
不 我认为你想要回神之使 因为你知道
No, I think you want the Godsend back because you know

823
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:02,767
这是你救赎自己的唯一机会
it's your one chance to redeem yourself

824
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,402
为你所做的一切付出代价
for all the shit you've done.

825
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:07,237
我想要回它 只因为它是我的
I want the Godsend back because it's mine.

826
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:17,748
泽夫的外骨骼正在渗漏
Ah. Zeph's exoskeleton is leaking.

827
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:25,656
是的 更多
Yep, more.

828
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:32,162
这边
This way.

829
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:06,563
暴跳 夹子
Blip, Clip,

830
00:56:06,564 --> 00:56:08,499
紧握
Grip,

831
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:11,802
小儿麻痹症 流感
Polio, Influensina,

832
00:56:11,936 --> 00:56:13,838
- 牛痘 - 你在说什么？
- Cowpox... - What are you saying?

833
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:16,774
我正在背诵我即将孵化的幼崽的名字
I'm reciting the names of me hatchlings.

834
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,676
因为你们中的一个要谋杀我
Since one of you is going to murder me,

835
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:22,279
我永远不会见到他们 但至少我可以向他们致敬
I'm never gonna meet them, but at least I can honor them

836
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,648
一个接一个
one by one.

837
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:25,149
旅行
Trip,

838
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:26,551
旅行二世
Trip 2,

839
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:30,721
扁桃体炎 克里米亚-刚果出血热……
Tonsilyitis, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever...

840
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:32,557
你要哭着说出19万孩子的名字吗？
Are you gonna sob out 190,000 names?

841
00:56:32,657 --> 00:56:34,725
你怎么能这么冷漠 如此无情？
How can you be so cold and insensitive?

842
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,494
他有可能记录下了发生的一切吗？
Might he have recorded what happened?

843
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:38,028
当然
Sure.

844
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,963
只是这段视频很可能和他一起被谋杀了
Except the footage was probably murdered along with him.

845
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:43,000
我们可以将其中一个三录仪连接到他的西装上
We could connect one of the tricorders to his suit.

846
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:45,602
无论剩下什么 我们都会知道是谁干的
Whatever data is left, we'll know who did this.

847
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:48,473
你这么说就好像我们都是嫌疑人一样
You say that like we're all suspects.

848
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:50,139
我们不是 好吗？
We're not. All right?

849
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,678
这一切发生时我和法兹都在船上
Fuzz, me and her were in the scow when all this happened--

850
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:56,080
每个人都留在别人的视线范围内
everyone in sight of everyone else.

851
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,415
没人去任何地方 对吧？
And nobody went anywhere, right?

852
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,451
对的
Right.

853
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:06,624
这不是泽夫的
Oh, this is not Zeph's.

854
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:10,528
深褐色头发 25厘米
Brunette. 25 centimeters.

855
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:27,211
这太疯狂了
This is insane.

856
00:57:27,344 --> 00:57:28,746
别再坐立不安了
Stop fidgeting.

857
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,380
我已经和泽夫近距离接触了一周了
I've been in close quarters with Zeph for a week.

858
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:32,082
好吧 所以你喜欢赛博格
Okay, so you're into mecha boom-boom.

859
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:34,218
很多人类都是 不必害羞
Lots of humans are. No shame.

860
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,192
嗯 那是不可能的
Well, that's impossible.

861
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:01,679
加勒特中尉
Lieutenant Garrett,

862
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:04,649
为什么你的指甲底下有泽夫的血？
why is Zeph's blood underneath your fingernails?

863
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,421
加勒特中尉
Lieutenant Garrett,

864
00:58:11,556 --> 00:58:14,291
在泽夫的尸体上发现了你的证据
evidence from you was found on Zeph's body,

865
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:17,294
泽夫尸体上的证据也在你身上发现了
and evidence from Zeph's body was found on you.

866
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,697
不太星际舰队
Not very Starfleet.

867
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:21,431
哦 我非常星际舰队
Oh, I am very Starfleet.

868
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:24,033
你知道我没有这么做
And you know I didn't do this.

869
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:27,605
你只是害怕任何有道德准则的人
You are just terrified of anyone with a moral compass.

870
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,843
在那颗纯洁的小心灵的深处
And deep down in that pure little heart,

871
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:35,913
你实际上是一个混乱的妖精 对吧？
you're actually a chaos goblin, aren't you?

872
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,448
- 我知道你是这样的 小天使 - 别这么叫我
- I know you have it in you, angel. - Don't call me that.

873
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:40,084
星际舰队嗅出了你
Starfleet sniffed you out

874
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:42,953
并把你放在一个最有用的地方
and put you in a place where you'd be most useful.

875
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:47,390
31区正是违反规则的军官该来的地方
Section 31 is just the place for officers who bend the rules,

876
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:50,628
在他们打破规则之前 永远不会完全打破规则
never quite break them until they do.

877
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:54,464
你很适合这里
And you fit right in here.

878
00:58:58,803 --> 00:59:00,971
你想怎么折磨我都可以
You can torture me all you want.

879
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:03,708
你永远不会让我成为杀人犯
You will never make me a murderer.

880
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:06,911
不是
No.

881
00:59:20,925 --> 00:59:22,627
我们拿到录像了！
We've got footage!

882
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:26,997
住手
Stop!

883
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:28,833
停止播放!
Stop!

884
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:32,169
这是我的装甲
This is my suit.

885
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,504
我即是装甲！
I am the suit!

886
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:37,974
装甲就是我！
The suit is me!

887
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:39,509
等一下
One second.

888
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:46,651
我们是你的朋友 我们是你的朋友
We were your friends. We were your friends.

889
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,452
你杀不了我
You can't kill me.

890
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:51,656
-泽夫 不 -你不能杀...
- Zeph, no. - You can't kill...

891
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,196
泽夫杀了自己？
Zeph killed himself?

892
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:00,831
他为什么要这么做？
Why would he do that?

893
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:06,236
抱歉让您失望了 陛下
Sorry to disappoint you, Your Majesty.

894
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:09,506
这一切根本说不通
Look, none of this is making any sense.

895
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,941
是啊 非常之不合理
No, none of it makes a lick of sense.

896
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,576
他为什么要这样做呢
Why would he do this? Uh...

897
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,544
给我几分钟 我们没时间了
- Give me a couple minutes to... - We don't have minutes.

898
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:16,881
就几秒钟
Well, then give me a couple seconds, then.

899
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:19,183
呃
Uh...

900
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:21,218
可能是你干的 也可能是你干的
- Could be you. - Could be you.

901
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:22,820
而且我连你长什么样都不知道
And I still don't even know what you look like.

902
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,554
你可以变形
You could change into anything you want.

903
01:00:24,689 --> 01:00:26,155
她是新来的 她才不在乎我们
She's new. She doesn't care about us.

904
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:27,857
我是星际舰队的 哇哦
- I'm Starfleet. - Whoa.

905
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:29,226
你们提到那套装备时
When you are talking about the suit,

906
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,061
就会想起泽夫
you're talking about Zeph.

907
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:33,063
这可不是法兹
This isn't Fuzz.

908
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:34,998
那个瓦肯人只是一个机器
The Vulcan's just a machine, you know.

909
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:36,532
我在里面呢
I'm inside.

910
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:38,135
奇耻大辱
Scale-shamer!

911
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:40,738
你绝对想不到我能钻进多小的缝隙
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

912
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:45,875
人体的内部系统
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

913
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,376
有个自动驾驶程序
There's an autopilot.

914
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,980
这是唯一合理的解释
That's the only thing that makes sense.

915
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:55,953
你给瓦肯机器设了自动驾驶程序
You set the Vulcan machine on autopilot.

916
01:00:57,454 --> 01:01:01,190
所以它的反应才那么古怪
That's why its responses were so strange.

917
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:04,128
你来不来 当然
- Aren't you coming? - Yes.

918
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:09,198
你钻进泽夫的外骨骼，控制了他的装备
You flew into Zeph's exoskeleton.

919
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:11,101
一旦你进入以后
And once you were inside...

920
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:13,237
有人把西塔接口拆掉了
Somebody ripped out  the theta junction.

921
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:15,205
加勒特 泽夫呢
Garrett, where's Zeph?

922
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:19,643
然后你接管了泽夫的装备
Then you took control of Zeph's suit.

923
01:01:20,745 --> 01:01:22,880
当别人在找他的时候
While the others were out looking for him,

924
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,581
你让他溜回了通讯阵列
you made him sneak back into the antenna array

925
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:28,052
然后发送了那些信息
and send those messages.

926
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:30,087
不要这么做
Don't do this to them!

927
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,456
我们是你的朋友啊
We were your friends.

928
01:01:32,556 --> 01:01:35,091
然后你销毁了所有证据
Then you destroyed the evidence.

929
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:36,626
还杀掉了泽夫
And you killed Zeph.

930
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,630
然后你把这一切嫁祸给加勒特
And then you planted the evidence on Garrett here.

931
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,470
举起手来 法兹
Hands up, Fuzz.

932
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,840
倒了血霉了
Oh, shite and ever shite.

933
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:59,649
等等等等 你们还要信她的鬼话吗 阿罗克
Whoa. You're honestly gonna believe what she says, Alok?

934
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,585
夸西 经历这么多你还相信她吗
Quasi, after everything we've been through?

935
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,391
我能先说一句吗
C-Can I just say one thing first?

936
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:14,264
我还能接入泽夫的外骨骼
I'm still hacked into Zeph's exoskeleton.

937
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:29,579
快点
Come on!

938
01:02:33,117 --> 01:02:36,053
说好的“不抛弃任何人”呢
What happened to "no crew member left behind"?

939
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:54,872
快一点啊
Come on, come on!

940
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:56,106
靠近他们
Get us closer.

941
01:03:52,897 --> 01:03:55,032
♪

942
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,979
逮到你了
I got you. I got you.

943
01:04:09,113 --> 01:04:11,715
小菜一碟  该死
- Nice and easy. - Damn.

944
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:12,542
你很关注黑市的动向
You keep tabs on the black market, hmm?

945
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,478
你就是在那听说天赐之物的消息的
And that's where you heard about the Godsend.

946
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:15,845
你怎么会在乎
Why do you care?

947
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:17,747
你杀了你的家人
You killed your family.

948
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:19,516
再多点人算什么呢
What's a few billion more people, huh?

949
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:22,419
他在哪 你在和谁说话
Where is it? And who are you working with?

950
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:25,288
你登上了王位
You took your crown while they died in agony

951
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:27,424
他们却死在你的脚边
not ten feet away.

952
01:05:28,192 --> 01:05:31,361
你奴役了你唯一的朋友
You condemned your only friend to slavery,

953
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:35,164
然后居然向他表示善意
and then you had the balls to offer him kindness at the end?

954
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,236
你怎么会知道
How could you know that?

955
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:42,039
你终于发现了
Glad you're catching on.

956
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:44,008
他把你耍了 皇帝陛下
He played you, Emperor.

957
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:46,043
San还活着
San's alive.

958
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,183
不可能
It's not possible.

959
01:05:55,019 --> 01:05:56,786
绝对不可能 怎么一回事
That's not possible. How?

960
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:59,456
他在培养对毒药的抗药性
He built up an immunity from that poison, you know.

961
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:02,726
每次只是很小的剂量
Teeny tiny doses over time.

962
01:06:03,994 --> 01:06:07,363
看样子是小混蛋又赢了一次
Once again, small shite for the win, mama.

963
01:06:08,532 --> 01:06:10,300
他在哪
Where is he?!

964
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,936
在出其不意的地方
He's gonna put on quite the show.

965
01:06:13,037 --> 01:06:15,072
你制造了神赐之物
You built the Godsend.

966
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:16,940
你让它成为了怪物
You made this monster.

967
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:19,209
全是因为你
This is all you.

968
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:04,754
小心点可以吗
Be careful, all right?

969
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:07,390
我说了小心点
I said be careful.

970
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,459
我还在船里呢
I have to get around in that.

971
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,332
你都能买得起一百多艘了还在乎这一艘
You can afford a hundred of them now.

972
01:07:15,465 --> 01:07:16,666
太好了
Oh, great.

973
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:18,835
我要激活一个
I'd settle for one that works.

974
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:22,606
所以就是这个
So that's it?

975
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:24,240
无敌的神赐之物
The almighty Godsend.

976
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:25,609
当你做上皇帝了
When you're emperor,

977
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:30,314
给它起一个没那么奇怪的名字
maybe start by naming it something less confusing.

978
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:45,128
当传送门打开时
Once that passageway opens up,

979
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:48,765
他会联系人族 他们会穿过传送门
he contacts the Terrans, they come through.

980
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:52,301
然后他们会引爆这里
They're detonating it here.

981
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:55,172
他成了帝国的宠儿
And he'd be the darling of the Empire.

982
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:58,074
联邦陷入混乱
So he throws the Federation into chaos...

983
01:07:58,175 --> 01:08:00,177
星际舰队自顾不暇
Starfleet will start scrambling.

984
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:01,978
入侵的完美时机
Perfect time to invade.

985
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:06,550
你创造了它
You gave birth to this thing.

986
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:10,687
- 我们要怎么阻止他 - 无法阻止
- How do we stop it? - We don't.

987
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,190
我们被困在这 追不上他
We're trapped here, so we can't follow him.

988
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,525
通讯天线坏了 我们也无法警告任何人
The antenna's destroyed, so we can't warn anybody.

989
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:17,026
胡扯
That is bullshit.

990
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:20,029
你肯定有更好的办法 没有
- You can do better than that. - I can't.

991
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,331
天赐之物是我
The Godsend is me.

992
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:24,634
我无法战胜我自己
I'm the only one I could never defeat.

993
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:29,373
过去总是缠着你不放
The past always catches up with you.

994
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:30,740
不是吗
Right?

995
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:37,747
但并不一定每次都赢
Doesn't mean it always wins.

996
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:41,885
每个安全屋都有备用计划
Every safe house, I have a backup plan.

997
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:43,520
把那艘垃圾船修好
We'll get that scow running.

998
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,856
老大 那家伙飞不起来的
Boss, the scow won't fly.

999
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,725
没有渐进线圈就不可能
Not without an asymptote coil.

1000
01:08:50,427 --> 01:08:52,196
我们有一个
We have one.

1001
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:54,097
我们会追上San的
We'll catch up with San.

1002
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:56,533
我们要阻止他联系人族
We'll make sure he can't contact the Terrans.

1003
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,067
你把线圈扯掉了
You ripped out the coil.

1004
01:08:58,202 --> 01:09:00,570
有内奸在 我可没法什么都告诉你
Couldn't tell you while a mole was still running around.

1005
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:05,409
你个混蛋
Asshole.

1006
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:20,457
夸西 去帮她一下
Okay, Quas, give her a rip.

1007
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:27,664
还是只有一个脉冲引擎
Still just one pulse.

1008
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:34,438
来活了朋友们
And we're in business.

1009
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:37,574
我们只有不到三十分钟时间
Okay, team, we have less than 30 minutes.

1010
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,208
夸西 设定航线前往新月星云
Quas, set a course for the Crescent Nebula.

1011
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:42,412
路上将会非常颠簸
All right, this is gonna be bumpy and bad.

1012
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,348
我推测san的星舰会有武器
I'm assuming San's ship will be armed.

1013
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:47,150
废话 所有人族星舰都是战舰
Yeah, every Terran ship's armed.

1014
01:09:47,284 --> 01:09:49,553
我们有光子炮 鱼类
He'll have proton cannons, torpedoes,

1015
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:52,656
还有一个大垃圾袋
and we are a garbage barge.

1016
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,224
你笑什么
Why are you laughing?

1017
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:56,260
因为我想不出来还有什么更糟的情况了
Because I can't imagine things getting much worse.

1018
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:03,399
出发
Let's go.

1019
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,078
这东西可以在牵引立场中飞行
So, this thing flies around in the middle of a tractor field.

1020
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:17,981
人们向太空里面扔垃圾
People jettison their garbage into space,

1021
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:19,916
然后这种驳船会拖着垃圾
and the scow flies around and drags the trash

1022
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:21,150
在力场中飞行
along with the field.

1023
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,120
一旦牵引立场充能完毕
Once the tractor field is full,

1024
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,855
就会把垃圾甩进星云里
it dumps the trash in the Nebula

1025
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:27,691
垃圾会在辐射里分解掉
where it disintegrates in the radiation.

1026
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:29,626
我就是想确认一下
I just want to be clear.

1027
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,495
你是想说我们最有可能用的上的武器
You're saying that our best potential weapon is

1028
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:33,330
是垃圾回收光束
a beam for collecting garbage?

1029
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:34,698
是 太棒了
- Yes. - Great.

1030
01:10:34,798 --> 01:10:37,567
你在那指手画脚帮不上一点忙
Hey, being judgy never helped anything.

1031
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,338
你要去哪 轮机室
- Where are you going? - Engineering.

1032
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:42,872
如果那是我们唯一的武器
If that's our only weapon,

1033
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,908
我要把所有的能量都导入那里
I'll redirect all power to the tractor beams.

1034
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:47,010
这计划确实不错呢
That's actually a good plan.

1035
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,399
就位了
We're in position.

1036
01:11:09,499 --> 01:11:11,467
传送门很快就会打开
The passageway will open soon.

1037
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:14,303
你知道我在这一切结束后想干什么吗
Do you know what I want when this is all over?

1038
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:16,673
这么大的一块空域
Just a big space, you know,

1039
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,476
让我和我的小家伙们到处乱飞
for me hatchlings to tunnel and fly around and...

1040
01:11:19,576 --> 01:11:21,545
你想干什么
What do you want?

1041
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:25,514
我要菲利帕乔久永远沉浸在她的失败之中
I want Philippa Georgiou to marinate in her own defeat.

1042
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:28,718
我懂你们的
I get you guys are all "eternal nemesis,

1043
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:30,554
你们都是那种复仇永恒论的人
sexy evil tension" and stuff, but...

1044
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:31,988
警报
Alert.

1045
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:33,390
有飞船靠近
Incoming vessel.

1046
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:36,325
检测到碰撞轨迹
Collision trajectory detected.

1047
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:38,595
她确实能把那玩意飞起来
Of course she got it off the ground.

1048
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,998
我建议我们用鱼雷
I say we should use the torpedoes.

1049
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:48,237
他发现我们了
They've picked us up.

1050
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:50,205
光子鱼雷来袭
Photon torpedo incoming.

1051
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:52,541
倒计时 五 四 我们需要进行规避机动
- Impact in five, four...- Really want to take evasive action right now!

1052
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:56,079
三 二 一  夸西 保持航线 护盾设置最大
- ...three, two, one. - Quas, hold the course. Put everything in our shields.

1053
01:12:01,685 --> 01:12:03,387
她为什么不改变航线呢
Why isn't she changing course?

1054
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:05,020
我看起来像是投机取巧的吗
Do I look like a fortune teller?

1055
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:10,159
我们有足够的能量牵引他们吗
Do we have enough juice to drag them with the tractor beam yet?

1056
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:11,961
有 但我们没法承受下一次直接命中的鱼雷了
Yeah, but we can't take another direct hit.

1057
01:12:12,095 --> 01:12:14,798
鱼雷来袭 五 四 三
Incoming torpedo in five, four...

1058
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:18,101
保持稳定 我们马上到了  三 二 一
- Keep it steady. We're almost there... - ...three, two, one.

1059
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:19,836
就现在

这就是星际舰队为何要你来这里的原因
