1
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,980
《星际迷航: 新世界》前情提要

2
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,340
向在通讯范围内的所有联邦星舰求救
To any Federation vessels in range, need help.

3
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,140
遭遇戈恩人袭击
Under attack by the Gorn.

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,300
如今星际联邦和戈恩霸权的关系非常紧张
The Federation's at a dangerous point in our relationship with the Gorn Hegemony.

5
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,250
这看起来像是一条分界线
It looks like a demarcation line.

6
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,040
帕纳索斯贝塔星和他们所有的武装力量
With Parnassus Beta and all their forces

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,080
在这条线的另一边
on the far side of the line.

8
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,770
不幸的是 我认为我们的人
Unfortunately, that is where

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,170
被关押在那里
I believe our people are being held.

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,080
我不打算丢下他们不管
I don't plan on leaving them behind.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,740
如果我头脑里藏着的东西是拯救进取号的答案
If somewhere in my head is the answer to saving the Enterprise,

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,870
那我必须冒这个险
then that's a risk I have to take.

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,980
拿着这个
Take this.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,760
它能帮你藏起来
It'll help you hide.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,280
快跑
Run!

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,840
在下蒙哥马利·斯考特
Montgomery Scott at your service.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,450
你怎么还活着
How are you not dead?

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,560
我知道如何隐藏在众目睽睽之下
Well, I figured out how to hide in plain sight.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,540
你造了个戈恩人的应答器吗
You built a Gorn transponder?

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,940
总的来说 对于扫描仪而言
Eh, basically, to a scanner,

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,630
我们的穿梭机看起来像是戈恩飞船
the shuttle looked like a Gorn ship.

22
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,820
你还能再造一个类似之前的设备吗
Could you build another device like the one you made?

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,980
发生什么了
What's happening?

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,360
巴特尔舰长需要马上注射镇定剂
Captain Batel is in need of immediate sedation.

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,320
昨天发生的
Happened yesterday.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,030
我不会放弃她的
I'm not giving up on her.

27
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,340
我也没那个打算
I have no intention of doing that.

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,100
舰长 传送机目前在星球表面上未探测到任何人
Captain, the transporter is not currently picking up anyone on the surface.

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,820
艾普里尔上将命令我们马上撤离
Admiral April's ordering our immediate withdrawal.

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,260
殖民地居民和外勤队
The colonists and the landing party

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,060
显然被传送到了
appear to have been beamed up

32
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,920
戈恩人的船上
by the Gorn.

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,000
舰长 请下令
Orders, Captain?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,140
现在 即将揭晓结局
And now, the conclusion.

35
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,540
舰长 请下令
Orders, Captain?

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,470
护盾只剩50%了
Shields at 50%.

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,990
舰长
Captain.

38
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,430
舰长 请下令
Orders, Captain?

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,820
乌乎拉 再重复一下上将刚刚的命令
Uhura, repeat April's last order.

40
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,730
撤退 并且
Retreat and rendez...

41
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,320
撤退并与舰队汇合 舰长
Retreat and rendezvous with the fleet, sir.

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,600
他给了坐标
He gave coordinates.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,880
但他没说要立即汇合 对吧
But he didn't say immediately?

44
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,500
行了 各位有什么点子吗
All right, who's got ideas?

45
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,440
声东击西
Diversionary tactics.

46
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,660
我们被围困得太厉害了
We're too boxed in.

47
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,160
排空曲速舱 制造一片等离子云团?
Vent the nacelles, create a cloud?

48
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,620
那我们自己也看不见了
We need to be able to see.

49
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,450
干扰敌方的通讯
Jam their comms

50
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,930
使其无法协调攻击
so they can't coordinate attacks.

51
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,320
对 就是这个
That's it. That's the one.

52
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,800
戈恩人使用光信号作为舰对舰通讯手段
The Gorn use light for ship-to-ship messaging.

53
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,920
我正在调整偏导阵列来发射光谱
I'm modulating the deflector array to emit a spectrum.

54
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,200
应该能迷惑他们一阵
Should confuse them for a bit.

55
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,990
好 现在想想要怎么把自己人传送回来
All right, now how do we beam our people back to Enterprise?

56
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,280
扫描显示戈恩星舰能够阻断传送
Scans indicate the Gorn ships are transport-resistant.

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,440
所以即便我们绕过了护盾
So, even if we get past the shields,

58
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,620
也需要授权码才行
we need authorization codes.

59
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,760
没时间去破解密码了
No time to hack codes.

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,240
先撤再救
Retreat and rescue.

61
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,940
这是一堆烂选项里最好的了
It's the best of a bunch of bad options.

62
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,400
那我们要怎样追踪一艘
So how do we track this specific ship

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,830
跨越数光年的船呢
across light-years of space?

64
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,420
沃凯矿 一种稀有元素
Wolkite. A rare element

65
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,140
含有子空间规范玻色子
that contains subspace gauge bosons.

66
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,660
如果我们调整一个定位信标
If we modified a homing beacon...

67
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,880
戈恩人远远地就能看到信标飞过来
The Gorn would see a beacon coming from a mile away.

68
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,080
如果是鱼雷就不会
Not if it's a torpedo.

69
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,180
我们对他们发射一颗哑弹
We tag 'em with a dud.

70
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,420
戈恩人猜不到我们要干什么
The Gorn won't know what we're up to.

71
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,410
护盾只剩30%了
Shields at 30%.

72
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,220
要想这个方法奏效 我们仍需穿透
For this to succeed, we still need to penetrate

73
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,480
戈恩星舰的护盾系统
the Gorn's defensive systems.

74
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,220
我们已经用上了所有武器攻击他们
We've been hitting them with everything we've got,

75
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,070
没多大用
it doesn't do much.

76
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,380
能量护盾基于谐波运作
Uh, energy shields work on harmonics.

77
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,120
如果我们找对频率
If we find the right frequency...

78
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,510
我们可以撞击敌舰
We can ram the ship.

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,600
确实
Indeed.

80
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,560
我们的护盾和他们的接触时
When our shields make contact with theirs,

81
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,300
两列谐波叠加时会出现相消干涉现象
they will create a destructive interference pattern

82
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,340
并在短时间内中断这两个频率的护盾
and momentarily interrupt both frequencies.

83
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,280
没有护盾 我们就是活靶子
With our shields down, we'd be sitting ducks.

84
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,400
那我们就只有一次机会
We'd only have one shot.

85
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,040
这就足够了
That's all we need.

86
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,220
米歇尔 调转方向
Mitchell, bring us around,

87
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,600
与敌方驱逐舰正面交火
head-to-head with the destroyer.

88
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,400
是时候来点硬碰硬了
Time to play a game of chicken.

89
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,720
全舰注意 做好冲击准备
All decks, prepare for impact.

90
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,460
随时可让脉冲引擎全速推进 舰长
Full impulse on your orders, Captain.

91
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,810
让惯性阻尼器最大功率运行
Inertial dampeners to maximum.

92
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,340
所有人 抓稳扶好了
Everybody hold onto something.

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,760
乌娜
Una...

94
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,920
动手吧
let's hit it.

95
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,440
发射鱼雷
Fire torpedoes.

96
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,660
舵手 曲速带离
Helm, warp us out of here.

97
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,520
遵命
On it.

98
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,490
坚持住 各位
Hang in there, guys.

99
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,620
舰长 我们已到达汇合点
Captain, we've arrived at the rendezvous point.

100
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,310
联邦星舰巴勃罗·毕加索号在联络我们
The USS Pablo Picasso is hailing to greet us.

101
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,020
是艾普里尔上将 舰长
It's Admiral April, sir.

102
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,740
他现在要传送上舰听取汇报
He's beaming aboard now to debrief.

103
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,520
还要打针吗
More needles?

104
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,860
没错 得再来几针
Yes, just a few more pokes.

105
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,280
没有这些
I mean, without these,

106
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,500
你的身体会在静滞场里面坏死 所以
your body will go necrotic in the stasis field, so...

107
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,020
你会变紫 会很难看
Things turn purple. It's not pretty.

108
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,440
我从没被冻结冬眠过
I've never been frozen solid before.

109
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,590
这前景不怎么激动人心
It's not an exciting prospect.

110
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,770
没事 等我们解决了这小小的戈恩卵感染问题
Well, as soon as we work out this little Gorn infection,

111
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,810
你就又能活蹦乱跳的了
you'll be up and around again.

112
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,860
（* 原文是指小说《瑞普·凡·温克尔》里主人公一觉睡了二十年 醒来发现世界已经天翻地覆）

113
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,860
感觉我会像小说里瑞普*那样 一醒来发现一切都变了
So this could be like a Rip Van Winkle thing for me.

114
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,430
我觉得你更会像是睡美人
I see you more as a Sleeping Beauty.

115
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,910
听着 我之前说的是认真的
Listen, I meant what I said before.

116
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,170
一旦那时要在我和其他船员之间做出选择
The moment it looks like me or the crew,

117
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,220
就牺牲掉我
you take me out.

118
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,780
不要想这些了
Don't think about that.

119
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,530
静滞状态会阻止你和戈恩胚胎
Stasis will prevent you and the Gorn

120
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,820
进行任何形式的细胞生长
from any type of cellular growth.

121
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,700
做好最坏的打算
There's another side to the coin.

122
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,320
无论代价如何
Whatever it takes.

123
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,410
无论代价如何 我保证
Whatever it takes. I promise.

124
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,190
我现在要给你注射镇静剂了
I'm, uh, I'm gonna give you a sedative now.

125
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,330
等你醒来 戈恩感染的问题就治好了
And when you wake up, you will be Gorn-free.

126
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,090
肾上腺素和中和剂 快
Epinephrine and neutralizer, stat!

127
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,440
她的身体正在排斥血清
Her body's rejecting the serum.

128
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,000
医务室呼叫舰桥
Sickbay to bridge.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,620
有个最新消息 情况不太乐观
Uh, I have an update, and it's not good.

130
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,620
告诉我最坏情况
Bottom line it for me.

131
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,900
巴特尔舰长对低温血清过敏
Captain Batel is allergic to cryoserum.

132
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,060
我们不能把她放进静滞状态
We can't put her in stasis.

133
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,260
那她的生命已经进入倒计时了吗
So she's back on a ticking clock?

134
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,220
她身体里的戈恩卵会在
The Gorn will hatch from her body in, um...

135
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,780
一天之内孵化
in less than a day.

136
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,510
我正在努力寻找治疗的方法
I'm stuck trying to find a treatment.

137
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,160
但是
Um... uh...

138
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,330
也许如果约瑟夫在这里 就可以
maybe if Joseph was here, I could...

139
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,440
我会派人去帮忙
I'm sending help.

140
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,800
克莉丝汀
Christine...

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,040
我相信你
I believe in you.

142
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,160
救救她
Help her.

143
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,700
我会尽我所能 舰长
I'll do my best, Captain.

144
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,580
舰长 我或许不是医生
Captain, I may not be a doctor,

145
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,900
但我能够把我所有的能力都奉献在巴特尔舰长的治疗上
but I will dedicate all of my abilities to Captain Batel

146
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,100
直到解决她的戈恩卵感染
until her Gorn infection is... resolved.

147
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,940
就只是看着?
Just stand by?

148
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,720
你可是有一整支舰队在待命啊
You have the entire fleet out there ready to go.

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,470
这是力量展示
It's a show of force.

150
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,400
我们先要建立起有效的巡逻
First we need to establish patrols.

151
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,820
他们真这么觉得吗
Do they really think

152
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,960
觉得戈恩人只要炸完这些殖民地
the Gorn are just gonna stop and go home

153
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,060
就会收手然后回家?
after they raided those colonies?

154
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,880
好吧 这是很棘手的情况
Look, it's a tough situation,

155
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
但我们必须一次解决一个问题
but we have to manage it one piece at a time.

156
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,400
无数无辜生命正危在旦夕 鲍勃
There are innocent lives at stake, Bob.

157
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,310
我明白
And I get that.

158
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,520
但这件事发生在我们的管辖范围之外
But it's happening outside of our jurisdiction.

159
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,080
拜托 鲍勃
Oh, come on, Bob.

160
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,520
除了你那不怕死的狗斗之外
Apart from your reckless dogfight,

161
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,820
这些攻击和联邦并没有关系
these attacks do not involve the Federation.

162
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,480
我们有规定的 克里斯
We have regulations, Chris.

163
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,230
所以 就因为死的不是联邦公民
So, because it's non-Federation citizens that are dying,

164
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,200
我们就作壁上观吗
we do nothing?

165
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,020
我们对于联邦成员国都有义务在身
We have an obligation to our member worlds.

166
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,940
那可是数十亿人
Billions of lives.

167
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,400
现在就贸然投入战争
To rush into a fight right now

168
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,160
会将所有人都置于危险当中
puts all of them at risk.

169
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,060
我们不能这样
We can't do it.

170
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,460
我们还没从克林贡战争中完全恢复
We're still recovering from the Klingon War.

171
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,040
你说得一点没错
You are absolutely right,

172
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,020
戈恩就是利用这一点发动进攻
and the Gorn sense our weakness.

173
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,760
我们现在是猎物
We are prey.

174
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
他们只会把这条霸权的边境线
They will push this Hegemony line

175
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,640
向着联邦领空内部推得越来越深
further and further into Federation space.

176
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,730
你也知道他们会这么做
And you know they will.

177
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,980
等到我们真的恢复过来
And by the time we actually get around

178
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,220
有精力反制的时候
to doing something about it...

179
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,980
一切就太晚了
it'll be way too late.

180
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,140
我听说了外勤队的事
I heard about the landing party.

181
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,880
对啊 还有几百号殖民地居民呢
Yeah, and a couple hundred colonists, too.

182
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,920
玛丽呢
And Marie?

183
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,380
她在医务室里
She's in sickbay.

184
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,960
官方地说 给你的命令是监控分界线
Officially, your orders are to monitor the demarcation line

185
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,480
避免戈恩人的进一步进犯
for any encroachment by the Gorn.

186
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,210
好 那不官方的呢
Okay. And unofficially?

187
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,910
为何不给他们点颜色看看 告诉他们我们不是猎物
How do we punch back and show them we aren't prey?

188
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,740
行 我接受这个
Yeah, I can do that.

189
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,340
你做的这个装置
This contraption of yours,

190
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,920
你再说一遍它是干什么的
what's it supposed to do again?

191
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,260
发射极化电磁信号
Emit a polarized EM signature that

192
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,280
诱骗戈恩 让它们以为我们是他们中的一员
tricks the Gorn into thinking we're one of them.

193
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,710
类似隐身装置的原理
It's like a cloaking device.

194
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,340
那么它究竟是怎么做到这一点的
And how, exactly, does it do that?

195
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,740
说实话 我不太记得了
Ah, if I'm being honest, I don't really remember.

196
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,000
我就是当时灵机一动
I was kind of in the moment.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,110
很好 那我现在要问一个很蠢的问题
Well, now I'm going to ask a silly question,

198
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,240
而且我确定我知道答案
to which I'm pretty sure I know the answer.

199
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,110
别又来这个
Not this again.

200
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,630
就像回到了报告厅一样
It's like being back in lecture hall.

201
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,500
你怎么知道 你又没去过报告厅
How would you know that? You were never there.

202
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,180
我去过 在后排而已
I was there, in the back.

203
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,340
你在把这堆东西拼起来时
Did you record a work-in-progress log

204
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,960
有没有记工作日志
while you were jury-rigging this up?

205
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,560
啥 您的意思是在戈恩人正在轰炸我的时候记录?
What, you mean as the Gorn were tearing our ship apart?

206
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,500
斯考特 工程学第一定律就是写下来
First rule in engineering, Scotty: write it down.

207
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,430
我们被要求无论什么情况下
There's a reason we track our work

208
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,780
都要记录自己的工作是有理由的
no matter what the circumstance, and this,

209
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,910
现在的这个情况 就是最好的理由
this right now, this is precisely the reason.

210
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,830
抱歉打断
Pardon the interruption.

211
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,400
你们还要多久能让这东西恢复运作
How long before you get that working?

212
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,920
哦 派克舰长 问题是
Oh, Captain Pike, the thing is,

213
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,560
它在我的小穿梭机上能起作用
it worked on my wee shuttle,

214
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,220
但进取号就
but the Enterprise is...

215
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,160
那您什么时候需要它呢 舰长
How soon do you need it, Captain?

216
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,640
我们正在航向戈恩的领空
We're headed into Gorn space,

217
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,500
所以现在能用就最好了
so now would be good.

218
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,840
在我们跨过分界线之前它会准备好的
It'll be up and working before we cross the Hegemony line.

219
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,580
我希望如此 因为我和船上所有人的命都指望在它身上了
I'm counting on it, as are the lives of everyone on board.

220
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,630
不管有没有这个装置
We're going after our missing crew,

221
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,760
我们都要去搜救被抓走的船员
with or without that device.

222
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,340
明白了吗
Understand?

223
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,260
哇 还真是一点压力都没有呢
Well, that's no pressure.

224
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,120
妈妈
Mom?

225
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,860
拉安 勇敢点
La'An, be brave.

226
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,320
对危险没有畏惧之心才会置你于死地
Not believing you're gonna die is what gets you killed.

227
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,150
那是戈恩人
It's the Gorn.

228
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,500
醒醒
Wake up.

229
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,720
快醒醒
Wake up!

230
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,420
你能做到的
You can do this.

231
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,300
第一个倒霉的总是医生
Always start with the doctor.

232
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,020
好了
Okay.

233
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,960
我的妈 我的手
Holy crap, my hand!

234
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,440
我他妈的半只手都没了
Half my hand is frickin' gone.

235
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,220
艾丽卡 看着我
Erica, look at me.

236
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,700
看着我 冷静下来
Look at me. Relax.

237
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,390
会没事的
It's going to be okay.

238
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,350
只要我们能回到船上就能治好它
We can fix this when we get back to the ship.

239
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,400
拜托
Please.

240
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,540
先保持冷静
Try to stay calm.

241
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,400
好吧
Okay.

242
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,880
但怎么
How?

243
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,060
我们怎么才能回到船上
How do we get back to the ship?

244
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,890
而且他们怎么办
What about them?

245
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,300
如果我们一次只能解救一个人
If we free them one at a time,

246
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,720
那我们能救出来的人屈指可数
we'll only get a handful out.

247
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,360
如果能的话
If that.

248
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,140
光是我们四个人脱困就花了这么久
Look how long it took for the four of us to get loose.

249
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,340
这是一个巨大的消化腔
This is a massive digestive chamber.

250
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,380
而且它正在消化
And it's working its way through...

251
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,780
看起来像是燃料加工厂
looks like a-a processing plant for fuel.

252
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,620
或者只是戈恩人的食物工厂
Or just food for the Gorn.

253
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,920
我真的不想变成哪个戈恩人的盘中餐
I don't like the idea of being anyone's lunch.

254
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,940
即便我们能够唤醒他们
And even if we can wake them up,

255
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,830
不管是一个还是一百个
one or a hundred,

256
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,230
我们还是没法离开这个
we still don't have a way out of...

257
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,060
不知道什么的地方
wherever this is.

258
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,700
先一步一步来吧
One step at a time.

259
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,240
要是什么都不做 就是等死
Sitting here doing nothing is a death sentence.

260
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,200
而且搞不好
And for all we know,

261
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,670
那些戈恩人可能在我们醒来那会就被惊动了
the Gorn were alerted the moment that we woke up.

262
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,580
所以那些杀人蜥蜴可能已经在来的路上了
So the killer lizards could already be on their way.

263
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,320
他们来了
They're coming.

264
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,060
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

265
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,460
拉安
La'An.

266
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,850
无论发生什么
No matter what.

267
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,780
拉安
La'An.

268
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,470
上尉 你在想什么
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?

269
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,520
你说得对
You're right.

270
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,650
不仅仅关乎我们自己
It's not just about us.

271
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,260
这些殖民地居民很快也会被杀害
All of these people will be dead soon.

272
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,780
看这
Hey.

273
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,740
这看起来像个排泄桩
This looks like an evacuation pile.

274
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,280
也许 这艘船不能处理的东西 都由它排出
Maybe whatever the ship can't process, it expels.

275
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,980
粪堆里的武器
Weapons from a crap pile.

276
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,290
怪了 这个方向是对的
Strangely, it's a step in the right direction.

277
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,430
我不想只救下屈指可数的人
I don't want to save a handful of colonists,

278
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,990
我想拯救全部人
I want to save them all.

279
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,140
所有还活着的人 都能回家
Everyone that's still alive gets home.

280
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,040
即使这意味着 我们必须杀出一条血路
Even if we have to shoot our way out.

281
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,840
哎呀 你个蠢货
Ack, bawheid.

282
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,920
不是这样
That's not it.

283
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,420
是戈恩人 他们来了
They're here!

284
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,640
该死
Oh, shite.

285
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,340
我们完蛋了 斯考提
We're doomed. Scotty.

286
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,940
不不不不
No, no, no, no...

287
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,220
我们都死定了
We're all gonna die!

288
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,000
成功了
It's working.

289
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,480
快通知舰桥 把它加到护盾上
Tell the bridge to patch it to the shields.

290
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,550
怎么 太晚了吗
What? Is it too late?

291
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,320
舰桥呼叫科学实验室 你们进展如何了
Bridge to science lab. What's the status down there?

292
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,800
我们马上要进入戈恩领空了
We're about to enter Gorn space.

293
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,380
真是狡猾
Oh, you minx.

294
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,750
已经在正常运行了 舰长
It's up and running, Captain.

295
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,280
我们现在就能把它加到护盾上
We can patch it into the shields now.

296
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
好极了 派克完毕
Excellent. Pike out.

297
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
一点都不好笑
That wasn't funny.

298
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
明明就很有趣
It was fun.

299
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,560
你差点害我心脏病发作
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

300
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,490
我那么做 是因为我了解你
I did it 'cause I know you.

301
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,740
你才不了解呢
No, you don't.

302
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,160
太了解了 平时闲得发慌的时候你就摆了
Yes, with too much time on your hands, you fall apart,

303
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,240
但要是有相位枪顶着你的头 你立刻精神百倍
but put a phaser to your head and voilà.

304
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
你管我这么多干嘛
Why do you care what I do?

305
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,160
你防备太重了 斯考提
You put up walls, Scotty.

306
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,780
你太害怕承担风险了
You're too afraid to take a risk.

307
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,840
我修好了你想让我修的东西
I fixed what you wanted me to.

308
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,520
而且你相当目无上级
And you're insubordinate to boot.

309
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,420
准确来说你又不是我的上级
Well, technically you're not my C.O.

310
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,980
她在驭星号上牺牲了
She went down on the Stardiver.

311
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,470
我可以离开了吗 长官
May I be excused, sir?

312
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,900
哦 斯考提
Oh, Scotty.

313
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,270
舰长 我们正在接近戈恩霸权领空边境
Approaching the Hegemony demarcation line now, sir.

314
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,780
脱离曲速
Drop us out of warp.

315
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,240
开启斯考特的应答器
Start Mr. Scott's transponder.

316
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,140
应答器?
Transponder?

317
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,720
佩利亚说它更像是一个改装过的电磁脉冲发射器
Pelia says it's more like a modified EM pulse emitter.

318
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,330
好吧 那就说得通了
Okay, then that makes sense.

319
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,500
戈恩人肯定不使用光学数据
The Gorn must not use optical data.

320
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,080
他们已经进化了
They've evolved,

321
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,380
所以他们一定依赖生物识别信息
so they must rely on biometrics,

322
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,620
热量和电磁信号
heat and EM signatures.

323
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,850
嗯 是时候看看这到底能不能成功了
Well, time to see if it actually works.

324
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,880
我的意思是 它应该可以
It should. I mean,

325
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,900
除非哪个戈恩人突然决定看一眼窗外
unless maybe one of them decides to look out a window.

326
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,690
舰长 戈恩狩猎舰正在接近
Captain, Gorn hunters approaching.

327
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,430
保持稳定航线
Keep us steady and on course.

328
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,680
目前为止 我没看到任何窗户
So far, I don't see any windows.

329
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,180
它奏效了
It worked.

330
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,370
乌乎拉 我们还能接收到沃凯矿信标的信号吗
Uhura, do we still have a signal from the wolkite beacon?

331
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,940
是的 舰长
Aye, sir.

332
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,540
信号很弱且在逐渐减弱 但它还在发射信号
It's faint and getting weaker but still there.

333
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,160
有关于他们去向的情报吗
Any intel on where they're headed?

334
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,500
一个未知的双星系统
An uncharted binary star system.

335
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,360
那里的恒星活动
The stellar activity there

336
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,250
是我们前所未见的
is like nothing we've ever seen before.

337
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,340
舵手 设置航线
Helm, plot a course.

338
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,700
舰长 那个星系的辐射高得超出量表
Captain, the radiation in that system is off the charts.

339
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,400
到最后 我们只能使用脉冲引擎
At a certain point, we can only use impulse engines,

340
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,480
进取号的护盾也无法抵挡辐射了
and our shields won't be able to protect us.

341
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,720
了解 那我们快速行动
Understood. We'll make it quick.

342
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,000
米歇尔 曲速七级
Mitchell, warp factor seven.

343
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,040
遵命 舰长
Aye aye, sir.

344
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,410
有趣
Intriguing.

345
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,860
戈恩卵的孵化进程大幅改变了她身体的生物化学结构
The incubation has severely altered her biochemistry.

346
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,960
她的身体现在依赖于戈恩的幼体
Her body is now as dependent

347
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,580
就像戈恩幼体依赖于她
on the Gorn hatchlings as they are on her.

348
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,760
完美的宿主 不可分割
The perfect host, inseparable.

349
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,460
你试过显微减瘤术了吗
Have you tried microscopic debulking?

350
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,860
模拟完毕
Results completed.

351
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,550
这是我最后跑的一次模拟
It's the last simulation I ran.

352
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,860
死亡率为100%
Probability of fatality is 100%.

353
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,080
我做的每一次模拟 结果全都一样
That's the chorus of the day. It's every simulation I've run.

354
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,950
计算机 模拟显微减瘤术的情境
Computer, run scenarios for microscopic debulking

355
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,060
将注射扎多拉提取物纳入模拟变量中
factoring for an infusion of Zadora extract.

356
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,420
正在处理
Processing.

357
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,160
猎户星的街头毒品?
An Orion street drug?

358
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,830
实话说 这真是天才想法
Actually, that's kind of brilliant.

359
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,200
是你教会了我跳出框架去看
You are the one who taught me to look outside of the box.

360
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,280
是「去思考」
It's "think,"

361
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,580
但也差不多
but close enough.

362
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,190
克莉丝汀
Christine.

363
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,560
我知道你想谈谈
I know you want to talk.

364
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,520
我会尽量简短
I will be brief.

365
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,070
我只是想为你离开前
I simply want to apologize

366
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,590
我们之间的结局道个歉
for the way things ended before you left.

367
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,290
我当时情绪有点失控
I reacted poorly.

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,720
好了
Apology accepted.

369
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,070
原谅你了
We're good.

370
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,950
失去你的念头
The thought of losing you,

371
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,950
深深困扰着我
it affected me deeply.

372
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,780
我理解
I understand.

373
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,660
事情变得复杂了
This has gotten complicated,

374
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,220
我不擅长应对复杂
and I am not good at complicated.

375
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,000
而我还是要离开三个月
And I am still going away for three months

376
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,010
去和罗杰·科尔比一起学习
to study with Roger Korby.

377
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,620
等我回来 再看看我们的状态吧
When I get back, let's just see where we are then.

378
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,490
所以你是想说
So you are saying that perhaps

379
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,010
也许分开一段时间 对我们有好处吗
some time apart might be good for us?

380
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,410
史波克
Spock.

381
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,420
是的
Yeah.

382
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,980
但不是说
But not like...

383
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,550
作为我们俩的我们
not like "us" us.

384
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,590
只是说
Like...

385
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,770
作为两个个体的我们
us as people.

386
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,210
请别做那些你觉得浪漫的事
Please don't do something you think is romantic,

387
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,080
像是等我之类的
like wait for me or something.

388
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,140
扎多拉提取物情境模拟完毕
Zadora extract scenario completed.

389
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,140
死亡率为100%
Probability of fatality is 100%.

390
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,870
无论我们用什么方法
No matter how we approach this,

391
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,960
巴特尔的人类基因
Batel's human DNA is...

392
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,310
都存在不足
Inadequate.

393
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,440
她的身体进入休克状态
Her body goes into shock,

394
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,460
血压开始下降
blood pressure drops.

395
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,400
最后死亡
And she dies.

396
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,320
哼 人类的身体始终有限
Huh. Human physiology.

397
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,800
但如果我们给她的基因帮点忙呢
What if we gave her some help there?

398
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,200
你已经有主意了
You have an idea.

399
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,810
伊勒利亚人的基因
Illyrian DNA.

400
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,260
乌娜的血液
Una's blood,

401
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,880
基因使其可以实时抵抗感染
it's designed to combat infections in real time.

402
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,440
一剂血清可以给巴特尔的免疫系统来一次大升级
A plasma injection could provide a boost to Batel's immunity.

403
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,550
这样我们就能在不使其休克的前提下
And we could attempt the surgery

404
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,860
尝试进行手术了
without her going into shock.

405
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,900
这样做违反规定
It is against regulation,

406
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,100
但能挽救她的生命
but it could save her life.

407
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,040
计算机 模拟手术结果
Computer, run scenario for surgery

408
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,360
将注射伊勒利亚血清纳入模拟变量中
factoring for a plasma transfusion from an Illyrian blood donor.

409
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,000
处理中
Processing.

410
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,390
你当时是怎么说的来着
How did you put it once?

411
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,830
有些规则就是用来打破的?
Some rules are intended to be broken?

412
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,090
几乎准确无误了
Almost exactly it.

413
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,820
这就是机库
There's the hangar.

414
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,840
好吧
Okay.

415
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,140
大家都了解计划吧
Everyone's clear on the plan?

416
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,700
访问这艘船的计算机主机
Access the ship's mainframe,

417
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,380
上传戈恩星舰的传送器密码
upload the Gorn transporter codes...

418
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,190
把他们带回进取号
Get them to the Enterprise.

419
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,820
要成功 我们必须偷一艘飞船 从这里飞出去
To do that, we have to steal a ship and fly it out of here.

420
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,820
这个看起来没什么警戒措施
That one doesn't look guarded.

421
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,460
我们超有把握 一点都不是不可能任务
Totally got this, not impossible at all.

422
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,940
你什么都能飞 是真的吧
And it's true you can fly anything, right?

423
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,680
别这么没礼貌 当然是真的
Don't be rude. Of course I can.

424
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,000
好
Okay.

425
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,430
来搞定那艘飞船吧
Let's get to that ship.

426
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,690
这是个好计划
This is a good plan.

427
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,640
一定行得通
It's gonna work.

428
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,130
这是个好计划
It's good. It's-it's...

429
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,880
是个好计划 对吗
It's a good plan, right?

430
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,350
当然了
It's a good plan.

431
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,180
没错 我们现在只需要
Yeah. Yeah. Now all we have to do is

432
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,270
别被戈恩人逮住
not get caught by the Gorn.

433
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,380
山姆
Sam.

434
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,230
你为啥要乌鸦嘴
Why would you say that?

435
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,180
不是姐们 这你也能怪我啊
What? Oh, come on, you can't blame me.

436
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,020
相位枪调到击杀档
Phasers to kill.

437
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,930
该走了
Time to go.

438
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,860
我和乌乎拉一直在钻研
Uhura and I have been poring over

439
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,640
手头能得到的戈恩人数据
all available data on the Gorn.

440
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,000
确认的袭击 未被证实的目击
Confirmed attacks, unverified sightings.

441
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,380
如果可能和戈恩人有关系 我们就检查过一遍
If it might be a Gorn, we've checked it out.

442
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,640
比我们想象的信息多出很多
And there's a lot more out there than we thought.

443
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,520
你得稍微用点想象力
You have to squint a little.

444
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,950
但是每一次戈恩目击事件
But every Gorn sighting correlates

445
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,260
都和某个特定的恒星活动规律正相关
to a pattern of specific stellar events.

446
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,360
日冕物质抛射
Coronal mass ejections.

447
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,560
我已经了解过了
I know this already, CMEs.

448
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,660
恒星耀斑爆发会引发强烈恒星风
Stellar flares can set off a frenzy.

449
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,610
是的 其活动遵循一定的规律
Yes, the attacks follow a pattern,

450
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,090
戈恩人的休眠也是如此
but so does Gorn inactivity.

451
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,270
这都是乌乎拉发现的
Uhura is the one who found it.

452
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,790
我们知道有很长一段时间
There are long periods of time

453
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,670
没有任何戈恩人活动的报告
where no Gorn activity is reported.

454
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,320
甚至连一点风声都没有
Not so much as a rumor.

455
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,100
在那个时间段
And in those instances,

456
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,100
独特的恒星活动似乎触发了某些东西
there's unique stellar activity that seems to trigger...

457
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,000
休眠
Hibernation.

458
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,890
没错
Yes.

459
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,160
我们认为戈恩人有着漫长的休眠周期
We believe that the Gorn have a long hibernation cycle.

460
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,340
在适当的条件下 它们会变得温顺
Under the right conditions, they become docile.

461
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,180
我们可以利用这一点
We can use that.

462
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,900
我们的科学团队协助了计算
The science team chipped in on the math

463
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,420
成功识别出X级太阳耀斑及其伴随的上弓下沉流
and was able to isolate the presence of X-class flares

464
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,730
两者在消失前均有明显前兆
and supra-arcade downflows that precede their absence.

465
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,080
做的好 你们俩
Good work, both of you.

466
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,820
还有一点
There's something else.

467
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,200
数据表明
The data also suggests that

468
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,260
我们可能正处于戈恩人长期侵略行为的初期
we could be at the beginning of a long cycle of Gorn aggression.

469
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,580
这些袭击可能预示着
These attacks could signal what

470
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,570
戈恩人即将发动全面入侵
could soon be a full-scale Gorn invasion.

471
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,360
舰长 我们将在两分钟后脱离曲速
Dropping out of warp in two minutes, sir.

472
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,060
谢谢你 米歇尔 我们这就来
Thank you, Mitchell. On our way.

473
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,060
史波克和查普尔知道自己在做什么
Spock and Chapel know what they're doing.

474
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,960
我相信他们
I trust them

475
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,810
会好好利用我的血液
with a couple liters of my blood.

476
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,120
谢谢你
Thank you for that.

477
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,080
他们说这可能是她唯一的机会
They say it may be her only hope.

478
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,620
为了玛丽 他们需要什么我都愿意提供
For Marie, they can take all they want.

479
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,200
这次任务不留存记录
This mission's already off-the-record,

480
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,780
所以也没什么好报告的
so nothing to report.

481
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,650
克里斯
Chris,

482
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,830
听一听你自己的建议吧
take some of your own advice.

483
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,090
要抱有希望
Focus on hope.

484
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,480
伊勒利亚血液供给方案已完成
Illyrian blood donor scenario completed.

485
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,190
死亡概率为86%
Probability of fatality: 86%.

486
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,700
只有这个方案能让她有一线生机
That's the first one that's given her any chance at all.

487
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,260
虽然成功率也不高
Albeit not a very high one.

488
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,140
按理说 不能在这种概率下进行手术
I mean, we can't do the surgery with these odds.

489
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,850
但总算有所进展了 我们继续努力
We're on to something. Let's keep at it.

490
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,480
好的
Indeed.

491
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,730
我们已接近辐射区
We're near the radiation zone.

492
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,990
从现在起 只能使用脉冲引擎
From here on, it's impulse engines only.

493
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,480
米歇尔 你连续工作很久了
Mitchell, you've been running nonstop.

494
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,580
去换班吧
Call for relief.

495
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,570
恕我直言 在把所有人都救回来前
With respect, I'm not leaving the station

496
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,220
我绝不离开岗位
until we get everyone back.

497
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,750
明白了
Copy.

498
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,580
谢谢你
Thank you.

499
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,320
我收到了沃凯矿的信号
I have the wolkite signature.

500
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,060
即将接近敌方驱逐舰
We're coming up on the enemy destroyer.

501
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,200
我们多久能追上他们
How soon can we overtake them?

502
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,460
克里斯 我们可能来晚了
Chris, we may be too late.

503
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,890
他们已经进入了辐射区
They've already entered the radiation zone.

504
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,840
如果我们继续深入当前星系
If we go any deeper into this star system,

505
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,300
全体船员都将陷入危险
we put the entire crew at risk.

506
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,420
舵手 立即停船
Helm, full stop.

507
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,080
主屏幕切换为远距离观测画面
Put the long-range visual up on the main screen.

508
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,250
是我的错觉 还是
Is it me, or does it look like

509
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,820
那艘船确实正朝着恒星的方向行驶?
that ship is going to fly right into that star?

510
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,940
我也看到了 简直难以置信
I see it, I don't believe it.

511
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,390
遥测数据已确认 舰长
Telemetry confirms, Captain.

512
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,620
我们必须做点什么
We have to do something.

513
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,340
你看
Look.

514
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,700
他们是失去动力了吗
Did they just lose power?

515
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,010
不是
No.

516
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,530
我认为他们是故意的
I think it was intentional.

517
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,620
但为什么呢
But why?

518
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,500
将全部备用能量传输至护盾
All auxiliary power to the shields.

519
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,080
尽可能争取在辐射区停留的时间
Give me as much time as possible inside that radiation zone.

520
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,380
我们追上去
We're going after 'em.

521
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,650
新一轮日冕物质抛射活动逼近
We've got another CME flare coming.

522
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,700
她快不行了
She's coding.

523
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,900
戈恩幼体正在孵化
The Gorn hatchlings are activating.

524
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,200
有什么东西加速了它们的生长
Something has accelerated their growth.

525
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,790
14%的成功率总比注定的死亡要好
A 14% chance of survival is better than certain death.

526
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,980
准备手术吧
Let's prep her for surgery.

527
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,380
我还能接收到沃凯矿的信号
I'm still getting a ping on the wolkite signal.

528
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,940
我们必须尽我们所能拯救我们的船员
We need to get to our people while we still can.

529
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,160
这里的磁场干扰让导航系统无法运作
The magnetic fields here make navigation impossible.

530
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,600
这就解释了戈恩星舰为何会像失去动力一样
That explains why the Gorn go into a free fall.

531
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,560
他们利用了强重力井来完成大部分机动
They let the intense gravity wells do most of the work.

532
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,470
星际舰队方面没有回复
No response from Starfleet.

533
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,300
都是因为这些辐射
It's all the radiation.

534
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,880
无论是进取号还是双星系统以外的区域
And no visuals on the ship

535
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,000
都无法获得影像反馈
or what's beyond the binary stars.

536
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,910
这种光线折射方式会生成一种自然全息投影
The light bends in a way that creates a natural hologram.

537
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,060
一旦穿过它 就无法被看到了
They're essentially invisible once they pass through it.

538
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,180
形成了绝佳的防御屏障
Makes for a great defense system.

539
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,010
也许那是一种降落程序
Maybe it's a landing sequence.

540
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,700
有没有可能 戈恩母星就在这
Could this be the Gorn homeworld?

541
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,230
如果假设成立 那这就是他们回母星的方法
If it is, that's how they go back to it.

542
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,600
舰长
Captain,

543
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,900
外面有情况
something's moving out there.

544
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,600
屏显
On screen.

545
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,490
一号
Number One.

546
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,720
我计算了他们的轨迹
I've plotted their trajectory.

547
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,830
那些舰船正径直驶向联邦领空
Those ships are headed straight for Federation territory.

548
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,900
警告星际舰队
Warn Starfleet.

549
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,440
只能使用深空通讯中继联络
It's a deep space relay.

550
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,140
我无法确实他们是否收到了讯息
I won't be able to confirm if they receive it.

551
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,280
我们得走了
We need to go.

552
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,760
离开该星系的干扰范围
Get clear of this system's interference.

553
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,620
舰长 如果我们现在失去沃凯矿的信号
Captain, if we lose our lock on the wolkite signal,

554
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,640
我无法保证我们能再次进行追踪
I'm not sure we can reestablish contact.

555
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,760
我们会失去外勤小队和殖民地居民
We'll lose the landing party and the colonists.

556
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,460
我们可以放置一个远程通信浮标
We can drop a long-range communication buoy.

557
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,980
将信号连接到浮标上
Tie a signal to it.

558
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,700
这样我们回来时就能找到他们了
That way we can come back for them.

559
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,370
这是我能想到的最好办法了
It's the best I've got.

560
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,180
就这么做
Do it.

561
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,990
我们必须阻止这场入侵
We have to stop this invasion.

562
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,820
通信浮标已部署
Communication buoy is deployed.

563
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,600
米歇尔 持续锁定敌方舰队
Mitchell, stay on that enemy fleet.

564
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,700
调转舰艏
Bringing her about.

565
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,560
尽快曲速离开这里
As soon as we can, you warp out of here.

566
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,780
全速前进 直到我们能够将警报发给星际舰队
Full throttle until we can alert Starfleet.

567
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,360
现在我们是联邦唯一的指望了
We're the only hope the Federation's got right now.

568
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:03,040
（* 此处查普尔和史波克穿的防护服与《原初系列》1x06 “The Naked Time” 中穿着的防护服是同一样式）

569
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,260
计算机 启动隔离模式
Computer, engage quarantine mode.

570
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,320
隔离模式已启动
Quarantine mode engaged.

571
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,160
如果失败的话 这就是法雷奥贝塔*的悲剧重演
If this goes sideways, it's, it's Valeo Beta all over again.

572
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,160
（* 见《奇异新世界》1x09 联邦星舰游隼号上爆发戈恩寄生疫情 坠毁在法雷奥贝塔五星）

573
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,640
戈恩卵疫情在全舰爆发的可能性将会是
The probability of a full-scale Gorn outbreak...

574
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,690
我真的不想知道
I really don't want to know.

575
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,650
查普尔护士 联邦星舰进取号
Nurse Chapel, USS Enterprise...

576
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,350
向患者巴特尔注射
...injecting Patient Batel

577
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,090
实验性血浆溶液
with experimental plasma solution.

578
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,320
有进展吗 少尉
Anything, Ensign?

579
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,160
通讯仍受阻碍 舰长
Still jammed, sir.

580
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,660
戈恩人正在发送干扰信号
The Gorn are transmitting an interference signal.

581
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,070
距我们离开双星系统进入曲速还有多久
How long before we clear these binary stars and go to warp?

582
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,200
时间不够
Not soon enough.

583
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,590
戈恩星舰的航速比我们快得多
Those Gorn ships are moving a lot faster than we are.

584
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,600
等警告发出
By the time we get a signal out,

585
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,860
戈恩舰队已经到达联邦外围成员国的位置了
the Gorn will be right on top of the outer Federation worlds.

586
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,940
他们只能坐以待毙
They're sitting ducks.

587
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,120
米歇尔 我们在戈恩舰队的武器射程内吗
Mitchell, are we in shooting distance of the Gorn?

588
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,320
克里斯
Chris,

589
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,040
你要让进取号对阵整个戈恩舰队吗
Enterprise against an entire armada?

590
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,700
我们根本不是对手
We wouldn't stand a chance.

591
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,280
派克呼叫科学实验室
Pike to science lab.

592
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,180
佩利亚 我需要你到舰桥来
Pelia, I need you on the bridge.

593
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,620
好的 舰长 马上来
Aye, Captain, right away.

594
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,020
你打算做什么
What are you up to?

595
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,670
你和乌乎拉
You and Uhura,

596
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,630
你们之前说恒星耀斑决定了
you said stellar flares can dictate

597
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,280
戈恩人的狩猎和休眠周期
a Gorn's hunting and resting cycles.

598
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,860
确实如此
Right.

599
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,770
我们甚至知道哪种辐射信号
We even know precisely what kind of radiation signature

600
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,500
可以让戈恩人陷入休眠
would tell the Gorn to go to sleep.

601
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,560
舰长 这只是理论上的
Um, sir, that's just a theory.

602
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,070
所以
So...

603
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,390
我们只需要人为制造一场恒星耀斑爆发
...we just need to create a stellar flare.

604
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,020
抱歉打断您 舰长
Oh, forgive me for interrupting,

605
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,870
但我们基本没办法对恒星造成什么影响
but you cannot make a star do much of anything.

606
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,800
更别说是精确控制耀斑爆发了
Certainly not precisely, Captain.

607
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,580
所以我们需要自己成为一次日冕物质抛射
Which is why we need to become a CME, uh,

608
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,390
也就是X级耀斑
X-flare ourselves.

609
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,240
舰长 你看
Captain, look.

610
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,480
抱歉 你介意腾位置吗
Uh, sorry, do you mind?

611
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,300
嗯是 用星舰来操作
Eh, sure, using the ship

612
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,500
的确能让我们精准调控发射的辐射和电磁信号
would allow us to modulate the exact radiation and EM signals we'd emit.

613
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,410
但你说的基本上就是
But you're basically talking about

614
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,280
把整艘船变成一颗人造恒星
turning the ship into an artificial star.

615
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,710
这基本上是不可能的
That's-that's nearly impossible.

616
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,180
但并非完全不可能
But not impossible.

617
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,340
为了达到这个目的 我们必须深入到
To do that, we'd have to go deeper

618
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,180
这个致死的辐射区里
into this deadly radiation zone,

619
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,940
径直飞过外面那对双星之间
fly right between those binary stars out there,

620
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,120
想办法制造一个对抗磁场
and create some kind of competing magnetic field

621
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,470
将粒子从双星中引开
to draw particles away from both of them.

622
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,820
需要调整偏导护盾 通讯阵列 还有
Modify the deflector shields, comms array, and, well...

623
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,860
基本上系统都得重改一遍
every-everything else, really.

624
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,650
连舰体都要磁化 才能吸引恒星物质
Magnetize the hull to attract stellar material.

625
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,650
成功的几率是千分之一
It's one in a thousand we'd get it done right

626
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,960
要么能完成任务要么炸飞自己 看吧
or don't blow ourselves up along the way, and, look.

627
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,050
我也不确定 但我愿意赌一把
Yeah, I don't know. I like those odds.

628
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,140
我们就
We'll just...

629
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,100
在爆炸前把它关闭
...turn it off before we blow up.

630
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,190
就这么办
Get it done.

631
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,580
患者对输血反应良好
Patient is responding favorably to the transfusion.

632
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,460
准备进行第一次手术切口
Ready to make the first incision.

633
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,660
等一下
Wait.

634
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,070
你知道最坏的情况是巴特尔舰长会殉职
You know the most likely outcome is the death of Captain Batel?

635
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,760
我们只是需要一点信心
We just have to have a little faith.

636
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,550
或许我们是从错误的角度来看待这件事的
Perhaps we are looking at this from the wrong perspective.

637
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,120
与其在治疗巴特尔上花时间
Instead of operating on Batel,

638
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,250
要是我们试着去对付一下戈恩人呢
what if we treated the Gorn inside of her?

639
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,400
它们想要孵化出来觅食
We know they emerge to feed.

640
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,620
要是我们给它们喂食呢
What if we feed them?

641
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,350
把它们喂饱 防止它们孵化
Satiate them to keep them from coming out.

642
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,580
当他们不再处于攻击状态时 把它们干掉
And when they are no longer in defensive mode, dissolve them.

643
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,570
并用乌娜的伊勒利亚血浆
And use Una's Illyrian plasma

644
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,440
来对抗他们在重新吸收过程中
to fight the multitude of infections that will result

645
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,720
产生的大量感染
from their reabsorption.

646
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,420
没错
Yes.

647
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,840
但我们没有时间再去模拟一次了
But we don't have enough time to run another simulation.

648
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,560
就像你刚才提议的那样
As you suggested,

649
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,940
也许我们只是需要一点信心
perhaps we just need a little faith.

650
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,470
我们甩掉他们了吗
Did we lose them?

651
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,140
或许吧
Maybe,

652
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,120
即便甩掉了 也是暂时的
but if so, then not for long.

653
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,660
这是个接口
This is an interface.

654
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,920
在戈恩的繁殖星球上
They had them on the Gorn...

655
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,360
也有这样的装置
the Gorn breeding planet.

656
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,740
我哥哥马努 他
My brother Manu, he...

657
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,840
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

658
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,980
无论如何 别停下来
Keep moving, no matter what.

659
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,740
嘿
Hey.

660
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,800
嘿
Hey.

661
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,590
你还好吗
Are you okay?

662
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,940
你现在在这里 而不是在过去的那个地方
You're here now, not back there.

663
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,380
是啊 但这里也没好到哪去 不是吗
Yeah, but here's not great either, is it?

664
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,380
是啊 确实很糟糕
No, I suppose not.

665
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,460
我有印象了 让我试试看
I remember. Let me try something.

666
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,800
太神奇了
This is amazing.

667
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,440
我很想把这个拆开 弄明白它是怎么运作的
I'd love to take this apart, figure out how it works.

668
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,480
真是好主意
Yeah, good idea.

669
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,640
在这待上一天慢慢研究吧
Let's make a whole day of it.

670
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,340
吃点零食 在这闲逛
Get snacks, hang out.

671
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,640
那些看起来像是缓冲信号
Those look like buffer signatures.

672
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,040
是的 还有传送授权码
They are. And the transport codes.

673
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,170
如果我们能把这个送回进取号
If we can get this to the Enterprise,

674
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,860
就能救走殖民地的居民
then we can save the colonists.

675
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,700
拯救所有人
All of them.

676
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,270
大伙们
Guys...

677
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,910
快去船上
Get to the ship!

678
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,580
我们就位了
We are in position,

679
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,200
正在接近双星
approaching the binary stars.

680
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,240
当我们关闭电磁脉冲发生器的瞬间
The moment we shut down the EM emitter,

681
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,220
每一艘戈恩星舰都会直奔我们而来
every single Gorn ship is going to come at us.

682
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,690
就像飞蛾扑火一样
Like moths to a flame.

683
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,090
这也正是我们想要的效果
Which is exactly what we want.

684
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,960
大家准备好了吗
Everybody ready?

685
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,100
像太阳一般闪耀吧
Make us shine like the sun.

686
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,570
驾驶位
The pilot seat.

687
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,130
让我坐驾驶位
Put me in the pilot seat.

688
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,220
我来驾驶它
Put me in the pilot seat!

689
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,570
别逞强了
Forget about it!

690
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,750
我能让它飞起来 这非我不可
I can fly it. It has to be me.

691
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,050
她说得对 我们必须得离开这
She's right. We need to go.

692
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,520
我们完全暴露在β粒子和伽马射线中了
We're covered in beta particles and gamma rays.

693
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,880
星舰正在承受着临界水平的辐射
This ship is hitting critical levels of radiation!

694
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,020
戈恩人在做什么
What are the Gorn doing?

695
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,960
他们已经脱离编队
They have broken ranks,

696
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,050
目前正处于进取号的拦截航线上
currently on intercept course with Enterprise.

697
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,480
目前看起来一切顺利
All right, so far, so good.

698
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,350
现在看看它们会不会向我们开火
Now let's see if they shoot at us.

699
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,100
舰长 我收到了一个
Captain, I have a signal bouncing off

700
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,490
通讯信标反射的信号
the communications beacon.

701
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,490
是拉安 长官
It's La'An, sir.

702
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,420
进取号 能收到吗
Enterprise, are you there?

703
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,320
拉安 你在哪
La'An, where are you?

704
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,590
在路上 如果能收到信号的话
On our way. If you can read me,

705
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,200
注意接收我向你们发送的传送密码
I'm sending you transport codes.

706
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,760
把帕纳索斯人传送出去
Beam the Parnassians out.

707
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,740
我们正在尝试传送
We're trying to beam you out,

708
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,940
但我们难以锁定你们
but we're having trouble getting a lock.

709
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,060
你们收到了吗
Do you copy?

710
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,720
它们正冲着我们来
They're gaining on us!

711
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,080
进取号 你们是否收到
Enterprise, do you read me?

712
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,210
把帕纳索斯人传送回舰
Beam the Parnassians out.

713
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,150
舰长 舰体完整性即将逼近极限
Captain, hull integrity is approaching critical failure!

714
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,160
把它关掉 关掉它
Turn it off. Turn it off!

715
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,980
起作用了吗
Did it work?

716
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,390
没错 舰长 最后一艘戈恩船只已返回母星
Aye, sir, the last of the Gorn have gone home.

717
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,540
帕纳索斯人呢
What about the Parnassians?

718
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,740
我们及时把他们传回来了吗
Did we get them out in time?

719
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,380
是的 舰长
Yes, Captain.

720
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,180
拉安的传送密码生效了
The transport codes from La'An worked.

721
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,320
几百名殖民地居民已经被救回
Several hundred colonists accounted for

722
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,190
正在送往应急医务室
and headed for the overflow infirmary.

723
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,180
舰长 我们急需--
Captain, we need immediate as--

724
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,580
将我们传送上舰并让一个医疗小组待命
Beam us out and have a medical team standing by.

725
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,140
派克呼叫轮机部
Pike to Engineering?

726
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,110
是 舰长 我们正在使用传送码
Aye, Captain, we're using the transport codes

727
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,860
破解戈恩狩猎舰的系统
to hack into the Gorn hunter,

728
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,180
应该很快就能搞定
should be just a moment.

729
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,940
克里斯 我们做到了
Chris. Chris, we did it.

730
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,600
我们引起了戈恩人的长时休眠
We triggered a long hibernation in the Gorn.

731
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,990
是啊
Yeah...

732
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,880
但我忍不住在想
But I can't help wondering

733
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,430
我们会不会只是把麻烦推给了未来的人们
if we didn't just create a problem for someone else to solve later.

734
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,650
舰长 我收到了艾普里尔上将的加密呼叫
Captain. I'm getting a secure channel from Admiral April.

735
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,830
接通
Put him through.

736
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,350
克里斯 我们刚收到你的优先级讯息
Chris. We just got your priority message.

737
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,380
在戈恩舰队到这之前我们还有多少时间
How much time do we have before the Gorn ships get here?

738
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,830
请忽略最后一条讯息
Ignore last transmission.

739
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,820
至少在一段时间内我们见不着戈恩人
We won't be seeing the Gorn, at least not for a while.

740
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,140
你有几分把握
How certain are you?

741
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,720
怎么说呢 我已经对戈恩人还以颜色了
Let's just say I found a way to punch back.

742
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,250
保持清醒 别晕过去
Stay with me. Stay with me.

743
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,560
我做的很棒
I did good.

744
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,730
不是吗
Didn't I?

745
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,650
别说话了 你能撑住的
Stop. You're going to make it.

746
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,350
想干掉我 他们还不够格
They'll have to try harder than that.

747
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,270
我可是艾丽卡·奥特加斯
I'm Erica Ortegas.

748
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,960
无敌舵手
I fly the ship.

749
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,700
撑住 有我在呢
Hold on. I got you.

750
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,640
我们尽力了
We did all we could.

751
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,640
现在要看巴特尔舰长自己了
It's in Captain Batel's hands now.

752
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,730
的确
Indeed.

753
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,820
谢谢你
Thank you.

754
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,090
没有你的话 我没法做到这一切
I couldn't have done that without you.

755
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,500
不用谢
You're welcome.

756
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,670
她怎么样了
How is she?
