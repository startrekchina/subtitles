00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,023
《星际迷航: 新世界》前情提要
Previously on Strange New Worlds...

2
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,100
我现在要给你注射镇定剂了
I'm gonna give you a sedative now.

3
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,327
等你醒来 戈恩感染的问题就治好了
And when you wake up, you will be Gorn-free.

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,920
我还在这里
I'm still here.

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,220
你能撑住的
You are going to make it.

6
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,740
我可是艾丽卡·奥特加斯 无敌舵手
I'm Erica Ortegas. I fly the ship.

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,940
伍中恋爱可能会导致一些复杂的问题
Fraternization can lead to complications.

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,200
就像我一直在告诉你的那样 我只是需要点个人时间
Like I've been trying to tell you, I just need some personal time.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,010
远离我的时间
Away from me.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,340
我正在考虑申请考古医学研究员的职位
About that fellowship, the archaeological medicine?

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,940
我得开始找人替补你了 是不是
I'm going to have to replace you, aren't I?

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,960
失去你的念头
The thought of losing you,

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,284
深深困扰着我
it affected me deeply.

14
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,520
但我还是要离开三个月
I am still going away for three months

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,880
去和罗杰·科尔比一起学习
to study with Roger Korby.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,789
等我回来 再看看我们的状态吧
When I get back, let's just see where we are then.

17
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:06,520
科学官个人日志
Science officer's personal log,

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,469
星历2251.7
stardate 2251.7.

19
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,200
在一号星站驻扎三个月后
After a three-month billet at Starbase One,

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,400
我们与戈恩人交战造成的损伤
the battle scars of our encounter 科尔比

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,560
已经被全数修复
with the Gorn are all but erased,

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,700
这给我留下了很多时间去思考
which has left me with a great deal of time to think.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,648
联邦日百年庆典
The Federation Day Centennial--

24
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:22,620
庆祝星际联邦成立
the 100th anniversary of the founding of

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,940
一百周年的日子
the United Federation of Planets--

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,119
还有三天就到了
is just three days away.

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,240
派克舰长认为 为联邦日组织一场庆典晚会
Captain Pike believes that hosting a ceremonial gala for Federation Day 

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,060
可以提振船员的士气
will improve morale among the crew.

29
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,100
每一位船员的士气
All of the crew.

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,480
查普尔护士结束外出 即将返舰
Nurse Chapel is returning from her time away.

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,860
自从她离开去参加项目后 我们就再未联系过
We have not spoken since she left for her fellowship.

32
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,320
因此 我也有一个更加私人的理由
As such, I have a more personal reason to prepare

33
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,972
来准备即将到来的庆典
for the upcoming celebrations.

34
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,931
放松你的肩膀
Loosen up your shoulders.

35
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,380
我的肩膀位置已经过精确测量
My shoulder placement has been measured precisely.

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,880
又没让你去精确测量肩膀位置
You're not supposed to measure them.

37
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,738
你该让它们顺其自然
You're supposed to let them flow.

38
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,440
就像这样
Like this.

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,240
我不明白
I am confused.

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,900
我不是已经按照你要求的参数
Am I not already performing the movements to the 

41
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,620
表演这些动作了吗
parameters you specified?

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,780
你是 你只是太僵硬了
Yes. You're just stiff.

43
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,720
就算是你 也僵得过分了
Even for you.

44
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,660
五 六 七 走
Five, six, seven, and...

45
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,100
请不要误会我的意思
Please do not take this the wrong way,

46
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,780
你在这项活动上的天赋令人惊讶
but your aptitude for this activity is surprising, 

47
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,080
而且恕我直言
and if I may say so,

48
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,700
我认为这种愿意尝试新事物的态度非常适合你
this openness to new life experiences suits you.

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,120
有那么一段时间
There was a time 

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,610
我最大的愿望就是成为一位芭蕾舞的首席演员
when I wanted nothing more than to be a prima ballerina.

51
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,280
我猜测是戈恩人改变了你的想法
I assume the Gorn changed that?

52
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,652
没错 我这辈子都在
That's just it. I've spent my whole life

53
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,300
等着他们卷土重来
waiting for them to come back.

54
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,960
就像是我童年床底下的怪物
My own personal nightmare under the bed.

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,540
然后他们真的回来了
And here's the thing-- they came back

56
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,894
而我打败了他们 就这样
and I beat them. Anyway...

57
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,900
但是呢
somehow

58
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,700
跟首席芭蕾舞演员比起来
the Gorn are less ravenous

59
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,760
戈恩人都算温顺的
than prima ballerinas.

60
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,660
也许这就是为什么瓦肯人原则上不跳舞
Perhaps that is why Vulcans, as a rule, do not dance.

61
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,260
看来就算是瓦肯人 也会为了特别的人而打破常规
It seems some of you will defy that rule for the right person.

62
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,660
在人类文化中 久别重逢之际进行隆重的浪漫表达
When humans reunite after a long absence, is it not tradition

63
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,245
难道不是传统吗
to make a grand romantic gesture?

64
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,015
史波克 我不想八卦
Spock, I-I don't want to pry,

65
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,820
但你和克莉丝汀不是决定
but I thought you and Christine had 

66
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,440
暂时分开 给彼此一点个人空间吗
decided to give each other some space.

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,060
确实
Indeed.

68
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,200
自从她离开去参加项目后 我们就再未联系过
We have not spoken since she left for her fellowship.

69
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,100
不过大家都知道 距离最容易牵动人心
But we all know what absence does to the heart.

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,660
如果没了「心」将会是致命的
The absence of a heart would be quite fatal.

71
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,931
不 史波克 这只是比喻 我是说
No, Spock, it's an idiom, it's...

72
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,960
进取号呼叫史波克先生
Enterprise to Mr. Spock.

73
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,560
你要我提醒你 那好 注意了
You asked for a heads-up, so, heads up.

74
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,040
查普尔护士请求传送许可了
Transport clearance request from Nurse Chapel.

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,913
她来了 我先失陪了
Please excuse me. She is here.

76
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,120
挺帅啊 史波克先生
Looking good, Mr. Spock.

77
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,026
你怎么在这
Lieutenant?

78
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,429
职责需要
Just doing my job.

79
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,260
查普尔在访客名单上加了人
Chapel added someone to the visitors list.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,898
有趣
Curious.

81
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,233
有点怪
That's funny.

82
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,960
刚刚某个瞬间
You know, for a wee moment there, I thought

83
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
我还以为我看到了一点异样
I saw a bit of strangeness.

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,380
什么样的异样
What sort of strangeness?

85
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,460
只是个船体外的传感器虚影
Oh, just a sensor ghost outside the hull.

86
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,820
但它现在不见了
But it's gone now.

87
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,100
没啥值得看的 长官
Nothing to see here, sir.

88
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,481
所有相关的扫描结果均处在正常范围内
All relevant scans appear to be within normal parameters.

89
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,700
斯考特中尉 传送两人上舰
Two to beam aboard, Lieutenant Scott.

90
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,660
史波克
Spock.

91
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,395
克莉丝汀
Christine.

92
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,298
这位是科尔比博士
Uh, this is Dr. Korby.

93
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,260
-你的研究项目指导? -嗯哼
- Your fellowship director? - Mm-hmm.

94
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,200
科尔比博士 向您问好
Greetings, Dr. Korby.

95
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,840
你好你好 叫我罗杰就行
How are you? Call me Roger.

96
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,873
我听说了不少关于你的事 史波克
I've, uh, heard a lot about you, Spock.

97
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,940
科尔比博士 我也读过许多您
Dr. Korby, I have read a considerable number

98
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,609
在考古医学领域上的论文
of your papers on archaeological medicine.

99
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,120
其实也没那么多
Oh, sure, there aren't that many.

100
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,400
一共有二百三十四篇 我说错了吗
There are 234. Is that not accurate?

101
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,860
没错 确实是这么多
It's actually exactly how many there are.

102
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,820
哇哦
Wow.

103
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,155
那是第一版的《萨塔凡图尔》吗
Is that a first edition of Saltavantur?

104
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,060
可以看看吗
May I?

105
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,120
这太不可思议了
This is incredible.

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,460
光是这个雕刻设计肯定就能追溯到
The engravings alone must date back to...

107
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,298
这是给克莉丝汀的礼物
It is a gift for Christine.

108
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,140
哇
Wow.

109
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,480
总之 欢迎登舰 科尔比博士
Well, welcome aboard, Dr. Korby.

110
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,740
需要为你安排住宿吗
Will you be needing quarters?

111
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,360
呃 不用了
Uh, no, no, I'm, um...

112
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,647
我有安排了
I'm taken care of.

113
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,760
他是来这里
He is here

114
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,420
和我一起参加百年庆典的
to attend the centennial celebration with me.

115
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,969
和你?
With you?

116
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,040
科尔比博士是我的约会对象
Dr. Korby is my date.

117
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:07,900
厉害
Okay.

118
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,240
八英尺高的鬣蜥都没能干掉我

119
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,860
你小子想打倒我 还远着呢

120
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,740
继续啊 老弟
Come on, baby boy.

121
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,280
是想吃我一记重拳吗

122
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,060
你接不住我的全力重击的
You can't handle the haymaker.

123
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,840
谁说的
Who even says that?

124
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,460
谁说的不重要 你努力还击就行了 我们继续吧

125
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,360
你真是个讨厌鬼

126
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,900
准备好吃拳头吧

127
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,374
别太得意 我可要打中了啊
Don't get cocky, I'll land one.

128
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,616
喂
Hey!

129
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,880
我早就告诉过你把摄像机关掉
I told you to turn that camera off.

130
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,780
我只是在做我的工作啊
I'm just doing my job.

131
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,440
是啊 你的工作
Yeah, your job

132
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,140
是拍摄星联百年庆典的纪录片
is a documentary on the centennial gala,

133
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,000
而不是拍摄我们训练
not this workout.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,620
我是一名专业的电影制作人
I am a serious filmmaker.

135
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,280
艾丽卡 可算找到你了
Erica, ah, there you are.

136
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,727
和你说件难以置信的事
You are not going to believe this.

137
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,341
克莉丝汀带了个男朋友回家
Christine brought home a date.

138
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:50,020
查普尔?
Chapel?

139
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,530
我刚知道的时候和你一样震惊
I'm just as shocked as you are.

140
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,531
嘿
Hey.

141
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,460
嗨 我是
Hi. I'm, uh--

142
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,620
重拳出击
Haymaker!

143
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,380
好吧 这是谁
Okay, who's this?

144
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,509
这是我弟弟
That's my little brother.

145
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,745
他从来就接不住拳头
Never could take a punch.

146
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,660
嗨
Hi.

147
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,514
我是妮欧塔
I'm Nyota.

148
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,880
行了 就快好了
All right, almost done.

149
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,480
不急的 少尉
Take your time, Ensign.

150
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,400
百年庆典的准备工作那么多
With all the centennial preparations I have to do,

151
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,640
这已经是我最接近度假的待遇了
this is the closest thing to a vacation I'm gonna get.

152
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
这就是最后一管了
Well, this is the last one,

153
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
但是我可以再抽几管
but I can take a bunch more.

154
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,398
说真的 一个人能需要多少血啊
I mean, how much blood does a person really need?

155
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,680
护士学校没教这个吗
They didn't cover that in nursing school?

156
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,080
我上课时候睡着了
Oof, I fell asleep.

157
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,238
还很经常
Like, a lot.

158
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,660
我挺喜欢你的 少尉
I like you, Ensign.

159
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,207
可是呢 现在查普尔护士回来了
Well, now that Nurse Chapel is back,

160
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,010
我的临时任命期就结束了
my temporary assignment is done.

161
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,211
话别说的这么绝对
I wouldn't be so sure.

162
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,648
别这样看着我
Don't look at me.

163
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:42,280
去看你的直属上司去
Take it up with your direct supervisor.

164
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,520
你猜对了
Guilty as charged.

165
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,460
我已经向星际舰队医疗部提交了申请
I put in a request with Starfleet Medical

166
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,987
希望把你的调任期限转为永久
to make your transfer permanent.

167
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,020
等等 别骗我啊 别最后告诉我只是恶作剧
Wait, wait, please tell me this isn't a cruel joke.

168
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,280
我们这最喜欢玩这种恶作剧了
We are big on cruel jokes around here.

169
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,240
等你第一次参加舰长的晚宴就知道了
Just wait until your first formal Captain's Table.

170
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,796
不过这次确实是认真的
But in this case, no.

171
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,620
很显然 你上司不舍得让你离开
Apparently, he isn't ready to give you up.

172
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,968
诚实地说 我们都不舍得看你离开 少尉
Frankly, none of us are, Ensign.

173
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,771
谢谢
Thank you.

174
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,058
能有你在 巴特尔舰长真是幸运
Captain Batel is lucky to have you.

175
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:11,180
玛丽恢复得怎么样了
How's Marie doing?

176
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,560
扫描结果显示 
Her scans show that 

177
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,000
戈恩胚胎残余物质已经被她的身体完全吸收了
the Gorn embryos have been fully reabsorbed.

178
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,221
是你的血让她的身体足够强韧
It was your blood that kept her body

179
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,100
才顺利撑过了代谢吸收的过程
strong enough to survive the metabolization process.

180
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,480
我们只是处理了一些轻微的后遗症罢了
All we're doing now is managing some minor aftereffects.

181
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,840
我都习惯了她的存在了
I've gotten used to having her on board.

182
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,720
她要是走了我还真有点舍不得
I'll be sorry to see her go.

183
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,901
要是如此 难过的肯定不止你一个
I imagine you won't be the only one.

184
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,606
说真的
I have literally

185
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,460
有些勋章我都不知道是为什么颁的
no idea what some of these medals are for.

186
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,080
而且我也不能全戴上 是吧
And I can't wear all of them, or can I?

187
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,180
挑着戴啊
Pick one.

188
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,981
不行 要是只戴一个
No. Because then I would insult 

189
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,900
没戴的那些人不就觉得我是在冒犯他们吗
whoever gave me the ones I'm not wearing and...

190
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,219
当一个你这么优秀的舰长真不容易啊
Must be hard being such an amazing captain.

191
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,500
呃
You, uh...

192
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,860
你是在物色自己的新座舰吗
shopping for a new starship?

193
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,360
上将说了 要什么样的星舰由我来定
Admiral April said I've got my pick.

194
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,720
这儿有各式各样的星舰可供选择
There are about a dozen commissions available.

195
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,600
很好啊
Okay.

196
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,560
那你想要什么样的呢
So, what are you looking for?

197
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,974
深空探索型
Deep space exploration.

198
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:16,509
但这样的话我就见不到你了
But then I never see you.

199
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,760
或者短距离的外交邮轮
Or short-range diplomatic courier.

200
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,148
但这样我还是会见不到你
But then I still never see you.

201
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,262
我到现在都觉得像是在做梦
It still doesn't feel totally real.

202
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,291
我本该死了的
I should be dead, I'm...

203
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,726
我还活着只是侥天之幸
I'm on borrowed time.

204
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,562
说到这个 我都明白的
Well, you're preaching to the choir on that one.

205
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,562
* 这句话字面意思就是「向唱诗班布道」

206
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,033
你这么说我都能想象出来你在唱诗班的样子了
Now I'm just picturing you in a boys' choir.

207
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,470
其实我以前还真是教堂的侍童
Actually, I was an altar boy.

208
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,580
你是个舰长 你会找到你的船的
You're a captain. You'll find your ship.

209
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,900
我只是希望这个过程能慢一点
I just wish it didn't have to be so soon.

210
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,111
你想说什么呢 舰长
What are you asking me, Captain?

211
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:56,080
实话说 我也不知道
Frankly, I don't know. I...

212
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,740
我只知道
All I know is that

213
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,920
我还没准备好和你分别
I'm not ready to let you go.

214
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,324
这就有点尴尬了
Well, this is awkward.

215
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,060
不好意思
Right, sorry.

216
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,000
刚刚我说的太过分了
It was too far. That...

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
逗你的呢
Relax.

218
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:13,080
我在想 等你和我搬到一起住之后
I was just wondering what you're gonna do

219
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,040
你要怎么办
when I move you into my quarters.

220
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,870
你那些护理头发的瓶瓶罐罐要放在哪
Where will all your hair products go?

221
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,384
嘿
Hey.

222
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,200
我把这个带来了
I-I brought this.

223
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,754
我觉得我应该还给你
I thought you might want it back.

224
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,589
这是给你的礼物
It was a gift.

225
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,720
我何必要反悔
Why would I not wish for you to have it?

226
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,829
之前的事 很抱歉
I'm sorry about earlier.

227
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,080
我没想让你和罗杰的第一次见面那么尴尬
I didn't want you to meet Roger like that.

228
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,820
你脸上那副惊讶的表情
The look of surprise on your face

229
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,120
几乎让我觉得这次失误值了
was almost worth the misstep.

230
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,271
这对我来说也不容易
This isn't easy.

231
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,520
我能问你一个直白的问题吗
May I ask you a direct question?

232
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,912
你哪次问的不直白了
Never known you to be any different.

233
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,760
你说你不希望进入一段
You expressed the desire to remain unattached,

234
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,240
正式的关系
free of commitment.

235
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,240
然而我却带了一个男朋友
And then I bring my new boyfriend

236
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,688
回家过节
home for the holidays.

237
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,191
是啊
Yes.

238
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:18,798
等我自己搞清楚了之后
When I figure that out for myself,

239
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,968
我发誓我会第一个
I swear you will be the first person

240
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,903
向你解释的
that I explain it to.

241
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,542
事实是 我自己也不知道
The truth is, I don't know.

242
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,040
就这么发生了
It just is.

243
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,760
斯波克
Spock.

244
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,917
我们还能做朋友吗
Are we gonna be okay?

245
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,125
我们今晚在舰上的餐厅有鸡尾酒会
We're having cocktails in the Port Galley tonight.

246
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,040
希望你能来
I hope you'll come.

247
00:13:56,937 --> 00:14:00,220
好吧 我就喝一杯 然后我就要回去训练了
Fine, one drink, then I have to go back and finish training.

248
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,610
之前谁还教我龙舌兰酒能当饭吃的来着
Aren't you the one who taught me tequila is its own food group?

249
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,600
来点龙舌兰能让你冷静下来 伙计

250
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440
你知道她是我们的通讯官对吧
You realize she's our communications officer, right?

251
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,460
她会的语言 有九百种了吧
She speaks, like, 900 languages.

252
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,100
烦人精姐姐语算是其中一种吗
Is "obnoxious big sister" one of 'em?

253
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,180
别劝她了 贝托 跟我一起去玩吧
Let it go, Beto. You can hang with me.

254
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,940
正合我意
That seems like a plan to me.

255
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,820
等一下 不对劲
Wait one damn minute.

256
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,620
你俩什么情况
This, you two...

257
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,120
跟对方说话的语气就像你们
...talking to each other like you're...

258
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,960
看对方的眼神也是 就像
and looking at each other like you're...

259
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,580
不行 这简直一团乱麻 疯了
No. It's chaos, madness.

260
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,834
你不放心把你最好的朋友交给我吗
You don't trust me with your best friend?

261
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,720
你不放心把你的宝贝弟弟交给我吗
You don't trust me with your baby brother?

262
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,541
行了行了 那我自己去训练了
Okay. Okay, I'll stay for a while.

263
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,575
但是你们不许当着我的面调情
But there will be no more flirting.

264
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,540
绝对不许啊
Literally none.

265
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,600
科尔比博士
So, Dr. Korby.

266
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,014
我是山姆 我得说 我非常敬佩
Uh, Sam. I got to say, I'm a big fan

267
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,700
您在高等古代文明研究方面的贡献
of your work on advanced ancient cultures.

268
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,140
报道说您最近的考古发掘是在瓦迪亚九号星
I read that your latest dig was on Vadia Nine.

269
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,720
是啊
Uh-huh.

270
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,640
那您有爬过迦勒山吗
Uh, have you climbed Mount Caleb?

271
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,240
是啊 我们爬过了
Uh, we did, actually. Yeah.

272
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,820
事实上 爬山的过程还挺浪漫的呢
It was, it was pretty romantic, actually.

273
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,194
斯波克先生
Uh, Mr. Spock.

274
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,460
很高兴你能来
Glad you could join us.

275
00:14:58,006 --> 00:14:59,780
我的工作提早完成了
I finished my work early.

276
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,120
科尔比博士正要给我们讲一个浪漫的故事呢
Dr. Korby was just about to tell us a romantic story.

277
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,403
-噢 那还是别提了 -是啊
- Oh, no,don't worry about it.- No.

278
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,772
-要不改天吧 -你们肯定不想听
- Some other time. - You guys don't want to hear...

279
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:06,900
-只是个超无聊的故事 -是啊
- Bore the life out of you. - Yeah.

280
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,060
我很乐意聆听
I would like to hear it.

281
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,543
最近我正在学习关于浪漫的知识
I have, of late, become a student of romance.

282
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,340
忽然好渴
Sudden thirst.

283
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,400
贝托 跟我一起去拿些饮料来
Beto, give me a hand with some drinks.

284
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,385
好吧 是这样的
Okay. Um... Well,

285
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,520
那是我小时候的事情了
uh, when I was a little girl,

286
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,320
每次我出门之前
whenever I would go away on a trip--

287
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,225
无论是去露营还是去学校
to camp, to school--

288
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,280
我妈妈都会对我说
my mother would always say to me,

289
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,480
「克丽丝 我希望你能找到属于你的阳光」
"Chrissy, I hope you find the sun..."

290
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,167
「愿你寻得属于自己的日月星辰」
"I hope you find the sun and the moon and the stars."

291
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:35,840
嗯
Yeah.

292
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,405
结果到头来 这句话成了她
And they turned out to be the last words

293
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,474
对我说的最后一句话
she ever said to me.

294
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,320
然后
And, um,

295
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,700
是这样 迦勒山刚好要高过太阳平面
Mount Caleb actually happens to break the solar plane.

296
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,460
所以太阳和月亮会同时出现
So, um, the sun and the moon are visible at the same time.

297
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,500
那天又是我妈妈的生日
And it was my mother's birthday.

298
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,320
我没有把这事告诉过任何人
And I didn't tell anybody

299
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,040
我一向如此
'cause I never do.

300
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,600
可是他注意到我情绪低落
Uh, but he just noticed that I was down and...

301
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,200
注意到这两件事的关联了
remembered the story and put two and two together.

302
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,631
我们到达山顶的时候
And when we got to the top...

303
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,280
登上山顶之后
When we got to the top,

304
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,400
我向她展示了绝美的天空
I showed her the stunning sky

305
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,007
然后送给她这个
and gave her this.

306
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,377
提拉利安星钻
Tilaryan Star Gems.

307
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,820
-这可是举世罕见的珍宝 -没错
- They're incredibly rare. - Yeah.

308
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,500
然后他说
And he said,

309
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,616
「你好像很难过
"You looked sad.

10310
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:28,654
所以我想要送给你日月星辰」
I wanted to give you the sun and the moon and the stars."

311
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,120
-祭酒来啦 -大家都来一杯
- Libations. - Shots, everybody!

312
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,871
-妙啊 -谢天谢地
- Fun. - Thank God.

313
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,041
好酷的手镯 哪里来的
Ooh, that's a cool bracelet. Where'd you get it?

314
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,694
晚上好
Good evening.

315
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,180
* 假装成瓦肯酒保的是特雷兰 见《原初系列》1x08「哥索斯的侍从」

316
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,663
准备好换一换口味了吗
Ready for a change?

317
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:13,460
我从未知晓 舰上有一位瓦肯酒保
I was not aware we had a Vulcan bartender.

318
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,834
临时调任
Temporary posting.

319
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,020
路过而已
Just passing through.

320
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:20,340
那么 要来一点不同 但是很赞的东西吗
So, something different but better?

321
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,442
你一定想尝尝的东西
Something you definitely want?

322
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:25,078
嗯 可以接受
Yes, that would be fine.

323
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:27,220
太好了
Fantastic.

324
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,783
我正好有你想要的
I have just the thing.

325
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,321
晃一晃酒杯 让香气散发出来
Swirl it around. Brings out the aroma.

326
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,320
别喝得太急
Don't drink it too fast.

327
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,958
会上头哦
It'll go right to your head.

328
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,234
早上好啊
Good morning.

329
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,642
早上好 你也是
Good morning back.

330
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,582
今晚不能和我睡一起哦
Tonight, no sleepover.

331
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:40,153
婚礼当天见到自己的新娘 会倒霉的
It is bad luck to see your bride on the day of your wedding.

332
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,096
科学官个人日志
Science Officer's personal log.

333
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:54,020
星历2251.7
Stardate 2251.7.

334
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,660
经过三个月的驻扎
After a three-month billet,

335
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,500
我们与戈恩人交战造成的损伤
the battle scars of our encounter with the Gorn

336
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,860
已经被全数修复
are all but erased.

337
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,020
在一号星际基地的停靠期间
And while docked at Starbase One,

338
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,840
我们的船员在为难得一遇的欢乐时刻做准备
our crew prepares to celebrate a rare and joyous occasion,

339
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,280
那就是我自己和查普尔护士的婚礼
the wedding nuptials between myself and Nurse Chapel.

340
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,800
你的第一支舞绝对会惊艳四座
Your first dance is going to be great.

341
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,917
你进步很大
You're improving.

342
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,084
并非如此
Untrue.

343
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,560
我从未理解 为什么需要用欺骗
I've never understood the need for deception

344
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,280
来缓和潜在的负面反应
to smooth a potential negative reaction.

345
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,420
和你结婚怕是要享受咯
You're just going to excel at marriage.

346
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,080
你结过婚吗
Have you ever been married?

347
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,140
我吗 绝对不可能
Me? God no.

348
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,000
我不是那种适合长期关系的人
I'm not really the commitment type.

349
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,941
我的童年经历 让我很难接受稳定的情感依赖
My childhood didn't really set me up for a stable attachment.

350
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,180
但是呢 一边跑一边朝后开枪
Now, shooting backwards while running,

351
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,813
我倒是很在行
that I can do.

352
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:45,084
我必须说 你最近看起来轻松了许多
Of late, I must say you have seemed lighter.

353
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,940
史波克 如果你现在还没练好
Spock, if you don't have it by now,

354
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,100
那就太晚了
then it's too late.

355
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,340
谢谢你 拉安
Thank you, La'An.

356
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,960
你一直是我很好的朋友
You have been a good friend to me.

357
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,096
我该去准备彩排了
I must prepare for the rehearsal.

358
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,180
各就各位 我们还有很多要做呢
Places, everyone! We have much to do.

359
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,209
婚礼又不是过家家 说办就能办的
A wedding doesn't just plan itself overnight, you know.

360
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,180
彩排就和正式仪式一模一样
And the rehearsal is just like the real thing,

361
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,120
只是可以穿舒服点的鞋子
only with comfortable shoes.

362
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,080
你们这位婚礼策划可真够可以的
This wedding planner of yours is something.

363
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,686
真没想到安多利人会这么注重细节
Never thought of Andorians as being so detail-oriented.

364
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,440
你们两个 就像太空舱里的两颗豆子
You two, you're like two peas in a space pod.

365
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,725
太登对啦
So delightful.

366
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,580
那就先从蛋糕开始吧
Let's start with the cake.

367
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,300
等等 罗杰去哪里了
Wait, uh, where's Roger?

368
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,300
我觉得我们应该等等伴郎吧
I feel like we should probably wait for my best man.

369
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,163
我来了
I'm here.

370
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,600
来了
I am here.

371
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,080
我还带来了蛋糕
And I have the cakes.

372
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,900
太好了
Excellent.

373
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,560
新鲜出炉 可香了
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

374
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,320
克莉丝汀 我可以和你聊一下
Christine, I couldn't just chat...

375
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,400
稍后吧 科尔比先生
Uh, later, Mr. Korby.

376
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,360
是博士
Doctor.

377
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,460
叫我科尔比博士
Dr. Korby.

378
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,760
好吧
Fine.

379
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,960
其实我还有一个特别的伴郎任务
Actually, I have a special best man task

380
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,713
专门需要你
just for you.

381
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,420
你能在那边等我一会儿吗
Could you wait for me way over there?

382
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,218
越快越好
Quick as you can.

383
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,100
真听话
Good one.

384
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,280
那么 史波克先生
Now, Mr. Spock.

385
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,940
我知道你想举办一场地球人风格的婚礼
I know you wanted to embrace a human-type wedding,

386
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,440
不过 要不要考虑混搭风
but what about fusion style?

387
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,131
我管它叫「人肯式」
I call this "Hu-can."

388
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,900
或者「瓦曼风」
Or "Vul-man."

389
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,280
尝尝看吧
Just try it.

390
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,140
你不喜欢吗
You hate it?

391
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:23,149
我没想到蛋糕会这么辣 这么咸
I was not expecting cake with quite so much heat and brine.

392
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,465
再尝一次 好不好
Let's try that again, shall we?

393
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,766
我来尝一块
Oh, I'll go.

394
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,940
史波克开玩笑的 蛋糕很美味啊
Spock's joking, this is delicious.

395
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,840
我能尝到巧克力和
Is it chocolate and, um...

396
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,060
瓦肯帕克洛尔?
Vulcan pahklor?

397
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,760
没错 帕克洛尔
Indeed, pahklor.

398
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,445
没什么能比帕克罗更能表达爱意了
Nothing says love like pahklor.

399
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,180
我刚才一定是弄错了
I must've been mistaken before.

400
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,320
确实很好吃
This is quite good.

401
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,100
不是很好 是完美
Not just good but perfect,

402
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,760
就像你们后面的婚礼一样
like your wedding is going to be.

403
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,980
现在来讨论一下编舞吧
Let's talk about choreography.

404
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,580
史波克 假设我们没有婚斗仪式这个环节
Spock, assuming we're not going to have a Kal-if-fee situation,

405
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,580
* 婚斗仪式是瓦肯习俗中两个瓦肯男性为了女性交配对象决斗至死的仪式

406
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,740
你会在那边的结婚圣坛
I have you over on the altar

407
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,760
你的伴郎派克舰长就在前排
and your best man Captain Pike in the front row

408
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,800
就在这里
just here.

409
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,480
乔瑟夫和乌娜呢
Joseph and Una.

410
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,808
你们簇拥着克莉丝汀 跳着华尔兹通过走道
I see you waltzing Christine down the aisle

411
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:24,110
然后将她转入史波克的臂弯
and then spin her into Spock's arms.

412
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,540
我可没有练习这个
I didn't practice that.

413
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,060
我为你准备了一个惊喜 害羞的新娘
I have a surprise for you, my blushing bride.

414
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,840
从地球的蒙福特州远道而来
Arrived all the way from Vermont, Earth

415
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,220
今早收到的
this morning.

416
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,254
我妈妈的手捧花?
My mother's flowers?

417
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,925
她在婚礼后把手捧花保存起来了
She had these preserved after her wedding.

418
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,120
噢不
Oh, no.

419
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,360
这些花看着是死透了啊
Those flowers look dead.

420
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,120
它们必须储存在精确的2.7度下
These were supposed to be stored at exactly 2.7 degrees.

421
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,860
-说真的 -我很抱歉 克莉丝汀
- I mean, the... - I'm so sorry, Christine.

422
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,520
有任何办法能拯救这些花吗
Is there any way to salvage them?

423
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,800
我的住舱里有一个复水仪
I-I have a rehydrator in my quarters.

424
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,480
听我说一句吧
I'll tell you what.

425
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,918
可能它们只是需要出来透透气
Maybe they just need to breathe.

426
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,060
看吧
I mean...

427
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,171
我的天 怎么可能
Oh, my God. What?

428
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:27,206
还真可以啊 我简直不敢相信
It worked. I can't believe it.

429
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,200
这就是为什么我们要彩排
This is why we have rehearsal.

430
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,820
既然解决了这个危机
And with that avertation of the latest crisis,

431
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,700
让我们继续吧
let's continue.

432
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,781
等你们两个都站在圣坛
With both at the altar,

433
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,416
交换了戒指 大功告成
we have the rings exchanged, and voilà.

434
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,880
每个人都像特纳兰蝙蝠一样开心
Everyone's as happy as a Ternaran bat.

435
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,880
克莉丝汀 我能和你说两句吗 拜托
Uh, Christine, can we just chat for two seconds, please?

436
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,980
很不巧 彩排刚刚结束
Unfortunately, rehearsal has just finished,

437
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,100
也就是说 查普尔护士 我必须要把你赶走
which means, Nurse Chapel, I'm gonna have to scoop you away

438
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,428
去最后试一次礼服
for your final fitting.

439
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,565
快点 该动身啦
So quickly, here we go.

440
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:55,400
拜托 别告诉你在婚礼上也准备穿着这件夹克
Please tell me you're not gonna wear that jacket on the day,

441
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,880
科布斯
Korbs.

442
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,620
嗨 你好吗 最近过得怎么样 
Hey, how are you? How're you doing?

443
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,560
科尔比博士 你在做什么
Dr. Korby, what are you doing?

444
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,417
我 呃
I'm, um...

445
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,440
想删掉你的婚礼誓词
...trying to delete your vows.

446
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,760
我就知道 蛋糕 还有手捧花
I knew it. The cake, the flowers,

447
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,160
你想要毁掉我们的婚礼
you are trying to sabotage our wedding.

448
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,493
是啊 你不能和克莉丝汀结婚
Yeah, y-you can't marry Christine.

449
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,220
是因为你爱上她了吗
Are you in love with her?

450
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,300
我是喜欢她 但这不是我这么做的原因
Yes. But that's not the reason.

451
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,720
不完全是
Well, not entirely.

452
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,880
听着 这场婚礼就不应该发生 明白吗
Look, this wedding is not supposed to happen, okay?

453
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,140
我不知道怎么向你解释
Uh, I can't fully explain it,

454
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,980
但是我们所在的现实被改变了
but our reality has shifted.

455
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,120
我觉得你该离开了 博士
I think you should leave, Doctor.

456
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,900
听我说完
Just listen.

457
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,980
克莉丝汀和我昨天才来到进取号
Yesterday, Christine and I arrived on the Enterprise

458
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,240
我们是来参加联邦建立百年纪念日的
to attend the Federation's Centennial.

459
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,313
我们特地把婚礼选在这个百年庆典的良辰吉日
We specifically chose the centennial as our wedding day.

460
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,840
不不不 我们就是为了纪念日才来到这里的
No, no, no, no. It is the reason we are here.

461
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,760
到昨天为止 还没有什么婚礼
As of yesterday, there was no wedding.

462
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,520
还没有什么「你和查普尔护士彼此爱恋」这一套
There was no "you and Nurse Chapel."

463
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,856
她明明和我在一起
She and I were together.

464
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,060
你是作为她的好朋友来参加婚礼的
You arrived together because you are best friends.

465
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,180
不 我们不是朋友 我们彼此相爱
No, not as best friends, romantically we are together.

466
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,365
只是似乎只有我一个人还记得这些事
But I seem to be the only one here that remembers that.

467
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,760
三个月前 我向查普尔求婚
I proposed to Christine three months ago,

468
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,680
这一切都发生在她去参加你的研究项目之前
before she embarked on her fellowship with you.

469
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,320
我好不容易才拿到祖母的订婚戒指
I procured my grandmother's engagement ring--

470
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,540
你说的这些都没发生过
None of that happened.

471
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,920
为什么只有我一个人记得
Why am I the only one that remembers this?

472
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,880
你们在她去进修之前就分手了
You parted ways before the fellowship.

473
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,020
确实 我第一次见到她的时候 她看起来很忧郁
And yeah, when I met her, at first, she was pretty gloomy.

474
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,140
我理解 分手确实让人难过
I get it, endings are... are difficult.

475
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,740
博士 我认为你应该去医务室检查下脑子
I think you should visit sickbay, Doc--

476
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,451
等等
Wait.

477
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,240
一开始 她确实只是学生
At first, she was a fellow, yes.

478
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,857
但事情很快就发生了变化
But she quickly became more.

479
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,392
她逐渐赶上
An equal.

480
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,740
不久之后 她在瓦迪亚九星的发掘现场与我共事那会
After a while, she was running the excavation site on Vadia Nine with me.

481
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,100
某天晚上 我们一起待到很晚
And one night, we stayed late.

482
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:12,538
我给她读了一首聂鲁达的诗
And I read her a poem by Neruda.

10483
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,112
「我渴望你的嘴唇 你的嗓音 你的秀发」
"I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair."

10484
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,112
* 出自聂努达《一百首爱的十四行诗·第十一首》

485
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:23,415
然后她
And she, um...

486
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,517
她吻了我
She kissed me--

487
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,065
哦 不好
Oh, no.

488
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,802
不好
Oh, no.

489
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,440
请冷静 科尔比博士
Please, Dr. Korby.

490
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,980
我需要向你道歉
I owe you an apology.

491
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,000
抱歉我打了你
Yes, for that.

492
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,950
而且 你说的对
But also, you were right.

493
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,550
现实确实被改变了
Reality has been changed.

494
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,252
一切都与原来不同
None of this is how it should be.

495
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,660
你想起来了?
So you remember?

496
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,140
是的
I do.

497
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,060
但我不确定是什么原因造成的
But I am not entirely sure why.

498
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,257
你有把这件事告诉克莉丝汀吗
Have you tried telling Christine?

499
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,100
我尝试过 但是她没有听进去
Yes, but she shut me down.

500
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,940
如此广泛的幻觉产生的原因
I've considered several possible explanations

501
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,300
可能有以下几个
for this mass delusion.

502
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,360
理论一 我们身处于一个平行宇宙中
First, that this is an alternate dimension.

503
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,140
但我已经检查了自身的相位变化 并无异常
I've already checked myself for phase variance and found none.

504
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,280
理论二 我们遭遇了某种环境致幻剂
Second theory: exposure to an environmental hallucinogen.

505
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,300
克莉丝汀和我同时到达进取号 所以
Christine and I arrived at the same time, so...

506
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,280
若这条理论成立 你也应当受到影响
You would both be unaffected.

507
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,610
说不定是某种外来病毒感染
Alien virus?

508
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,360
生物过滤器近期刚完成了升级 所以应该不是病毒造成的
The bio-filters have been recently upgraded.

509
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,640
或者是某种不确定场
Perhaps an improbability field?

510
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:33,652
* 出自《奇异新世界》2x09「子空间狂想曲」

511
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,740
我们遇到过这种情况 导致我们一直在
We once entered one that made us...

512
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,652
歌唱
sing.

513
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,721
可能吧
Perhaps.

514
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:36,255
我已经知晓了现状
Now that I am aware of the situation,

515
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,692
我不会继续参加这场婚礼仪式了
I will obviously not proceed with the nuptials.

516
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,096
你大概没得选
You may not have a choice.

517
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:47,540
每当我试图阻止这场婚礼
Every time I've tried to stop this wedding,

518
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,836
就会有东西妨碍我
something has interfered.

519
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,370
你是觉得这件事中
You are suggesting the presence

520
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,637
有某种具有改变现实能力的
of an advanced intelligent life-form

521
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,540
高级智慧生命体在干涉
with reality-altering capabilities.

522
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,700
是的
Yes.

523
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,509
但为什么只有你没有受到影响
But why leave you unaffected?

524
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,677
这个嘛
Well...

525
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,814
可能是我缜密的理性思维
...my rigorous intellect may have

526
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:04,283
使我的头脑免受幻觉的影响
shielded my mind from the illusion.

527
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,319
博士
Doctor.

528
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,600
如果这个条件成立
If one of our intellects could bestow immunity,

529
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,758
我确信不受影响的一定不会是你
I am confident it would not be yours.

530
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,640
跟我来 我们可以去科学实验室对整艘船进行扫描
Come. We can use the science lab to scan the ship.

531
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,520
如果有异常能量出现 应该可以检测到
Any anomalous energy should be detectable.

532
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,838
棒极了 又是那个讨厌的安多利安人
Great. Another Andorian annoyance.

533
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,400
啊 终于找到你了
Ah, there you are!

534
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,580
在这最幸福的婚礼的前夕
Greetings and many felicitations

535
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,160
向你致以真诚的问候
on this happiest of wedding eves.

536
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,320
哦 科尔比先生
Oh, Mr. Korby.

537
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:33,760
是博士
Doctor.

538
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,540
怎么哪儿都有你
You really are everywhere, aren't you?

539
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,548
狗皮膏药似的
Bit like a rash.

540
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,940
说到这个 婚礼那边的其他宾客
Speaking of which, the rest of the bridal party

541
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,220
正在享受面部护理
are enjoying facials.

542
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,020
你要不要也去体验一下
Perhaps you should join them.

543
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,420
你看起来有点呆
Are you sleeping?

544
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,260
是不是没睡好
Are you sleeping?

545
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,700
黑眼圈这么重 肯定是没睡好
The bags beneath your eyes say no.

546
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,760
我亲爱的新郎 你看这些衣服怎么样
My darling groom, what do you think of this?

547
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,580
这个颜色很衬你的瞳色
The color really brings out your eyes.

548
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,860
可以延后吗 我现在有一些紧急事务需要处理
Could this wait? I have urgent duties to attend to.

549
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,700
别傻了
Don't be silly.

550
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,900
现在 你最重要的任务就是结婚
Right now, your most important mission is matrimony.

551
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,020
这件就可以了
That one will be fine.

552
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,440
我们得走了
Come. We must go.

553
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,700
说了是博士
It's Doctor.

554
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,013
哎呦 博士呢
"It's Doctor."

555
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,784
这实验室挺不错
Nice lab.

556
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,180
执行全舰扫描程序 这应该会耗费几分钟
Initiating ship-wide scan now. It will take a few minutes.

557
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,300
我在想你是怎么意识到这是一场幻觉的
I was thinking about how it was that you became disillusioned.

558
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,800
我挥出那一拳的那一瞬间
At the moment I punched you,

559
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,760
就好像我脑海中迷雾消散了
it was as if a fog in my mind lifted,

560
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,680
然后我就知道了
and I knew.

561
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,340
也许是肾上腺素和皮质醇的突然爆发造成的
Perhaps it was the sudden burst of adrenaline and cortisol that did it.

562
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,735
也有可能是因为
It is also possible that whatever power

563
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:31,737
当我们直面真相的时候
is creating this false reality cannot be maintained

564
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,571
这场错误的幻觉就无法维持下去了
when so directly confronted with the truth.

565
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,940
无论如何 我们都需要找到办法
Regardless, we must find a way

566
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,620
告知舰长当前的情况
to communicate the situation to the captain.

567
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,180
那祝你好运了
Good luck with that.

568
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,620
终于找到你了
There you are.

569
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,540
你怎么不在自己的房间待着
You were supposed to meet me in your quarters.

570
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,060
不管这是什么 我都不能喝
Whatever this is, I cannot.

571
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,080
山姆 你带来的是什么
Sam! What do we have here?

572
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,080
来选明天婚宴主桌要上的葡萄酒吧
These are the wine selections for the head table tomorrow.

573
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,129
请你认真听我说 柯克上尉
Listen to me very carefully, Lieutenant Kirk.

574
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,360
进取号停泊在一号星站是为了
Enterprise came to Starbase One

575
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,500
庆祝联邦建立百年纪念日
to celebrate the Federation Centennial.

576
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,369
而不是婚礼
Not a wedding.

577
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:05,838
查普尔护士早已和我分手
Nurse Chapel and I are no longer a couple.

578
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,960
我们不会结婚
We are not getting married.

579
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,000
你正处于一种未知现象的影响下
You are suffering from an unknown phenomenon.

580
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
很有可能我们遭到了某种袭击
It is possible we are all under attack.

581
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,515
我懂的
I get it.

582
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:19,840
我理解你 史波克 你想打退堂鼓
I get it, Spock, you have cold feet.

583
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,100
这太正常了 你听我说
It's totally normal, look--

584
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,800
给我一拳
Punch me.

585
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,955
啥
What?

586
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:27,326
我揍你干什么
I'm not gonna punch you.

587
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,360
你做事马虎
You are sloppy.

588
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,629
不如你的兄弟聪明
Less intelligent than your brother.

589
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,289
没有人喜欢你的胡子
No one likes your mustache.

590
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,080
而且你对酒的品味很差
And you have terrible taste in wine.

591
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:48,013
如果我在你婚礼前夕给你打得眼眶乌青
If I gave you a black eye the day before your wedding,

592
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,415
克莉丝汀会杀了我的
Christine would kill me.

593
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,016
扫描完成
Scan complete.

594
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,886
当前并未检测到异常能量读数
There are no anomalous energy readings present.

595
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:56,956
就要霞多丽葡萄酒吧
Perhaps the chardonnay.

596
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,580
舰长 我们需要报告紧急情况
Sir, we have an urgent situation.

597
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,140
我非常清楚 少校
I am aware, Lieutenant.

598
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:07,832
喝了这个就好了
And there. Fixed that.

599
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:11,437
史波克先生 欢迎来到你的单身派对
Mr. Spock, welcome to your bachelor party.

600
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,860
-嘿 -史波克哟
- Hey. - Spock-o!

601
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,580
我准备了所有你喜欢的东西
Spock! I prepared all of your favorites.

602
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,820
瓦肯巨贝 普克塔
Jumbo mollusk, Pok-tar, and 

10603
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,820
* 分别出自《深空九号》2x06 以及《进取号》1x08

604
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,345
还有看看我找到了什么
look what I found.

10605
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,878
鲁土格
Lutrog.

606
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:23,680
还有为我们其他人准备的
And something imbibable for the rest of us:

607
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,960
蜥蜴白兰地
Saurian brandy.

608
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,100
哦 说实话 我不怎么喝酒
Oh, honestly, I'm not really much of a drinker.

609
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,354
我几乎碰不了那东西
I hardly touch the stuff.

610
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,056
我觉得吧 按照习俗
I believe tradition dictates

611
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,692
准新郎在踏入婚姻坟墓之前 得先说段祝酒词
the groom-to-be give us a toast before he walks the plank.

612
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,360
对啊 演讲
Yes, speech.

613
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,430
来吧 史波克先生
Come on, Mr. Spock.

614
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,534
我们所在的现实遭到了改变
Our reality has been changed.

615
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,440
查普尔护士早已和我分手
Nurse Chapel and I are not together.

616
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,280
她现在和科尔比博士恋爱了
She is in love with Dr. Korby,

617
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,441
但现在只有我和他记得这件事
and only he and I remember this.

618
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,816
敬史波克 世界上最幸运的人
To Spock, the luckiest man in the world.

619
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,040
对 敬史波克
Yes, to Spock.

620
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,319
-史波克先生 -干杯
- Mr. Spock. - Cheers.

621
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,157
舰长 进取号正在遭受大规模幻觉影响
Captain, Enterprise is experiencing a mass delusion.

622
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,480
我就说吧 他又打退堂鼓了
I told you. Cold feet.

623
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,759
我没有在打鼓 多谢关心
My feet are perfectly warm, thank you.

624
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,061
我是认真的
This is serious.

625
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:12,320
放轻松 史波克
Relax, Mr. Spock.

626
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,300
我知道这对你来说很难
Which I know is difficult for you.

627
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,136
所以才要请你吃鲁土格
That's why the Lutrog.

628
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:20,880
要慢点吃啊
Careful with that.

629
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,720
到目前为止 情况似乎已经很清楚
It seems clear by now that being confronted 

630
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,112
仅仅告知大家真相并不足以打破这种魔咒
with the truth is not enough to break the spell.

631
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,380
这就只剩下情感反应这一途径了
Which leaves us with emotional response.

632
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,448
但我们已经观察到了各种各样的情感
But we have seen a range of emotions

633
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,450
却没有一种能驱散这种幻觉
and yet none dispel the delusion.

634
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:38,400
生气 愤怒 这是最强烈的一种情感了
Anger, rage, it's one of the most powerful emotions there is.

635
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,460
或许需要另一种同样强烈的情感
Perhaps another equally powerful emotion.

636
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,120
比如什么
Like what?

637
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,040
爱
Love.

638
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,160
对了史波克 我差点忘了
Mr. Spock, I almost forgot, 

639
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,600
婚礼策划人请你评价一下座位安排表如何
the wedding planner asked you to weigh in on the seating arrangement.

640
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,240
不介意的话 请看看第八排
Take a look at row eight, if you don't mind.

641
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,680
呃 舰长
Uh, Captain?

642
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,040
一共有多少人受邀出席了这场婚礼
How many guests are invited to the wedding?

643
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,760
全体船员以及 107名登记的来宾
All the crew and, uh, 107 registered guests.

644
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,660
谢了
Thanks.

645
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,460
计算机 当前进取号上
Computer, how many individuals

646
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,660
除了船员和登记的来宾
are currently aboard the Enterprise

647
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,455
还有多少其他个体的存在
besides crew and registered guests?

648
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,511
一个
One.

649
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,680
婚礼有个不速之客
We have a wedding crasher.

650
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,040
就藏在我们眼皮底下
Hiding in plain sight.

651
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,928
计算机 定位该个体的位置
Computer, locate that individual.

652
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,620
符合条件的个体位于左舷餐厅
The individual fitting that description is in the Port Galley.

653
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,260
史波克 你要去哪
Spock, where you going?

654
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,806
待会还要去唱卡拉OK呢
We're gonna do karaoke.

655
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,240
噢 科尔比先生 史波克先生
Oh, Mr. Korby, Mr. Spock.

656
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,980
你们不是应该在参加单身派对吗
Shouldn't you be at your bachelor party?

657
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,280
我正在准备招待会的特调饮品
I'm working on a specialty drink for the reception.

658
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,180
二位觉得石榴汁怎么样
How do we feel about pomegranate?

659
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,190
我不需要一场狂欢宴
I do not need a bacchanal.

660
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,700
那你就该好好睡个美容觉
Then you should get your beauty rest.

661
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,620
我现在也睡不着
I do not need to sleep.

662
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,523
那就数玛梵入睡吧
Count tribbles, then.

663
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,320
你 你就是那个实体
You. You are the entity.

664
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,020
哦 史波克先生
Oh, Mr. Spock.

665
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,560
你那瓦肯式幽默感每次都能逗到我
Your Vulcan sense of humor gets me every time.

666
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,000
还记得吗 我是你的婚礼策划人呀
I'm your wedding planner, remember?

667
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,060
你旋转着走进我的办公室 满心沉醉在爱意中
You twirled into my office, drunk on love,

668
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,980
梦想着一场既梦幻又让人喜不自胜的婚礼
wishing for a wedding day full of magic and unspeakable joy.

669
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,907
梦想?
A wish?

670
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,120
那一晚 就在这个地方
That night, here in the Port Galley,

671
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,711
你那会也是酒保
you were the bartender then, too.

672
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,520
我希望我和克莉丝汀之间的情况能有所不同
I wished things could be different with Christine.

673
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,200
而你让它成为了现实
And you made it so.

674
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,140
不用谢
You're welcome.

675
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,540
这不重要
It does not matter.

676
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,340
我们不会进行这场婚礼
We are not going through with the wedding.

677
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,400
你必须将其复原
You have to fix this.

678
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,591
你不能就这样操控人们的思想
You can't just control people's minds.

679
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,540
我爱怎么样就怎么样
I can do anything I want.

680
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,100
我是个婚礼策划师
I am a wedding planner.

681
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:34,400
此外 我不喜欢被别人破坏我的计划
And I do not like it when people ruin my plans.

682
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,960
醒一醒 史波克先生
Wakey wakey, Mr. Spock.

683
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,440
今天是你的大喜之日
It's your big day.

684
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,640
你不能强迫我继续演这场戏
You cannot force me to continue this charade.

685
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,654
哎呦 真的假的
Can't I, though? 

686
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:49,540
要是你惹我生气的话
Do you know what would happen

687
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,160
不用想大家会是什么样的下场吧
to everyone if you made me mad?

688
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,725
我甚至都想象不出来下场
I don't think I can even imagine it.

689
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,580
哇 快看
Well, look at that.

690
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,733
我的小型瓦肯生态皿
My own little Vulcan terrarium.

691
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,969
我的朋友们肯定羡慕坏了
My friends will be so jealous.

692
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:09,308
现在知道要乖乖听话了吗
I do hope you'll play along now, yes?

693
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,120
我听到婚礼的钟声敲响了
I can hear the wedding bells.

694
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,540
哎哟 看看你 真是帅气啊
Ah! Look at you, you look great.

695
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,377
所以婚礼都应该在沙滩上进行
All weddings should be on the beach

696
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,760
而且所有人都应该穿着短裤
and everyone should be in shorts.

697
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,347
好吧
Okay.

698
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,502
我一直在找你
I have been searching for you.

699
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,000
他逼着我做伴郎
He's made me the maid of honor.

700
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,320
他说如果我不乖乖照做的话
And he says if I don't play along,

701
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,380
他要把我们都发配到玉米地里去
he's gonna wish us all to a cornfield.

702
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,380
* 发配到玉米地是《阴阳魔界》里的梗 见该剧集的3x08

703
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,580
我不明白玉米地有什么特殊的含义
I do not understand the significance of this wish.

704
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,060
这是个梗 算了
It's from a... Doesn't matter.

705
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,960
他的意思是把我们都从现实中抹除
He's talking about wiping us from all of existence.

706
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,180
是的 他也这样威胁我了
Yes, he made this threat to me as well.

707
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,902
你得把这件事做完
You're gonna have to go through with this.

708
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,900
就是 可能唯一的解决办法
Just... Maybe that's the only way to end it,

709
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,400
就是顺着他来
play his game.

710
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,611
史波克 到时候了
It's time, Spock.

711
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:21,220
咱们让你成婚吧
Let's get you married.

712
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,720
请大家落座
Please be seated.

713
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,820
今日能齐聚一堂
What a delight

714
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,200
共同见证如此特别的时刻
 to be gathered here today to celebrate 

715
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,820
真是令人欣喜
something so special,

716
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,880
一种比最快的星舰更强大的力量
a force more powerful than the fastest starship.

717
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,260
人类称之为爱
Humans call it love,

718
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,780
而我听说 爱可以战胜一切
and I'm told love can conquer all things.

719
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,640
克莉丝汀
Christine--

720
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,408
嘘 早了
Shh. Not yet.

721
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,281
你们都有准备誓词吧
Do you both have your vows?

722
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,760
不行
No.

723
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,100
不
No!

724
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,420
我反对
I object.

725
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,300
还没到那个环节呢
We're not there yet.

726
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,240
罗杰 你在干什么
Roger, what are you doing?

727
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,640
克莉丝汀 你必须停下
Christine, you have to stop this.

728
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,740
该停下的是你
You stop.

729
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,080
你不能就这样改变别人的感受
You can't just make people feel things

730
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,295
改变别人的真情实感
that they don't really feel!

731
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,500
够了
That's it.

732
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,020
请继续 史波克先生
Please, continue, Mr. Spock.

733
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,540
人类诗人聂鲁达曾写道
The human poet Neruda wrote,

734
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,140
「我渴望你的嘴唇 你的嗓音
"I crave your mouth, your voice,

735
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,394
你的秀发
"your hair.

736
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:50,180
我不说话 不吃喝
"Silent and starving,

737
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,397
游荡在街头巷尾
"I prowl through the streets.

738
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:54,900
面包无法果腹
"Bread does not nourish me,

739
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,535
黎明只会令我发狂
"dawn disrupts me,

740
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,640
整日里
"all day

741
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,640
我追寻你脚步流水般的韵姿」
I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps."

742
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,378
这就是爱你的感觉 克莉丝汀
This is what it is like to love you, Christine.

743
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,800
而值得你的爱的人
And the person worthy of your love,

744
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,040
必须要勇敢
they must be courageous.

745
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,387
不能沉溺迷失
They cannot be drowning.

746
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:16,722
不能摇摆不定
They cannot be unsure

747
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:19,920
也不能任由自己的情感风暴裹挟
or at the mercy of their own emotional storms.

748
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,695
他必须是你灵魂的港湾
They must be a safe harbor.

749
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:27,833
要能为你守住一方宁静
They must have the ability to hold space for you.

750
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,300
去看到你
To see you.

751
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,969
最真实的你
Just you.

752
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,373
他必须听得见你未曾出口的呼唤
They must be able to hear your unuttered call.

753
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,240
要能够把一切都交予你
They must be able to give you everything.

754
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,287
必须能把
They must offer you the moon

755
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:53,525
日月星辰
and the sun and the stars

756
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,427
都一并赠予你
all at once.

757
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,400
我并不清楚你母亲的生日是哪天
I did not know when it was your mother's birthday.

758
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,470
我没告诉你
I didn't tell you.

759
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:07,820
这不是谁的错
It's no one's fault.

760
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,921
这不对 史波克
This is wrong, Spock.

761
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,852

罗杰
Roger...

766
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,520

770
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,100
够了
That is it.

771
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,571
大家都得死
Everybody dies.

772
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,140
就从这条狗开始
And I'm starting with the dog.

773
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,460
你离他远点
You keep away from him.

774
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,700
准备好迎接你们的末日吧
Prepare for a cavalcade of death.

775
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,100
你们今晚谁也别想吃到婚礼蛋糕
No one gets a wedding cake slice tonight.

你要死翘翘了
You'll be dead.

然后你 戴着皇冠的 脑子里装的啥
And you with the crown, what were you thinking?

779
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,080
是想抢新娘风头吗
Tried to outshine the bride?

780
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,922
还有你们几个蓝脸的 你们明知道我穿着蓝色衣服
And you blue faces, you could see I was in blue.

781
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:58,320
你们哪来的胆
How dare you.

782
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,560
去死吧你
Death to you.

但说实话 我挺喜欢的
Actually, that's... I like that.

00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,240
就放过你吧
You can, you can live.

00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,167
这是什么情况
What is this?

789
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,380
* 配音演员同时也是Q的演员 主创也确认这里就是Q

拜托别在这丢人现眼的了
Please, let's not make a scene.

793
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,580
噢 天哪
Oh, my...

794
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,120

但他们一点都不配合诶
But they're not playing along.

796

他们压根不听我的
They're not listening to me.

797
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,021
然而你也不听我的话
And you are not listening to me.

798
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:34,360
还用我再向你说明一遍不听话的下场吗
Shall I show you once more what the consequence is for disobedience?

799
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,661
不用
No.

800
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,797
我会听话的 我保证
I'll be good, I promise.

801

等等 你还只是个孩子吗
Wait, you're a child?

802
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,080
很小的孩子
A very young one.

803
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,060
按照地球时间算才八千岁
Only 8,000 of your Earth years.

804
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,560
是八千零二十岁 爹
8,020, Dad.

我还不想走
I don't want to go.

807
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,809
等一下 在你离开之前
Wait, before you leave...

808
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,720
我想知道你为什么这么做
...might I ask why?

809
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,460
这个嘛
Well...

810
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,700
看那家伙
Look at him.

811
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,620
我发现他在老家那边挖来挖去的
I spotted him digging in the dirt on the old homeworld.

812
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,460
他实在是完美 一个又帅又聪明的人
He's just so handsome and smart and perfect.

813
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,980
看到他就火大
It's just annoying.

814
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,560
是 这确实合乎逻辑
Yes, that does make perfect sense.

815
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,420
喂
Oy.

816
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,740

好吧
Okay.

818
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,580
拜拜咯
Tallyho.

819

822
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,220
那个 呃 刚刚那件事很奇怪
That was, uh, that-that-that... that was strange.

823
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,110
这场什么婚礼的共同幻觉
A shared delusion about a wedding

824
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,660
可真是个新鲜事 是吧
is a new one, isn't it?

825
00:43:01,493 --> 00:43:04,215
好吧 呃 联邦日
Okay... Uh, Federation Day.

826
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:06,551
在2161年 星联的创始种族们
2161, the, uh, founding species

827
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:10,822
聚集在一起创立了 呃 星际联邦
came together to create, uh, the Federation.

828
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,323
呃 主要是为了回应
Um, largely in response

829
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,193
我们与其他外星种族的「友好互动」
to our interactions with other foreign species.

830
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:17,460
这期间发生了一些非常尴尬的事情
Some of them very awkward.

831
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,760
呃 所以用一种
Uh, so it's only fitting

832
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,366
与其同样尴尬的活动
that-that our-our centennial be marked

833
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:25,760
来纪念联邦成立百年
by a-a-a similar awkward,

834
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,139
挺合适的
uh, interaction.

835
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,955
总之 今天酒吧畅饮
And the bar is open.

836
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,520
这看着好好喝
Those look incredible.

837
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,620
* 这里的酒保是埃多斯人 这也是该种族首次在真人剧集中出现 之前均是在动画剧集中出现

838
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,640
可以给你调一杯 但这是阿拉妮黑麦威士忌
I'll make you one, but it's Alanni Rye.

839
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,464
它会在你的食道和它下面的东西
It will burn a hole through your esophagus

840
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,420
全部蚀穿个洞出来
and whatever is below your esophagus.

841
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,269
地板可能也难逃一劫
And maybe the floor.

842
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,580
那就请给我两品脱吉尼斯黑啤吧
Two pints of Guinness, please.

843
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,240
这个也许稳妥点
Probably a safer bet.

844
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,860
你是进取号上的医官吗
Are you the doctor from the Enterprise?

845
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,560
约瑟夫·姆'本加
Joseph M'Benga.

846
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,240
我有点想念你戴着花冠的样子了
You know, I kind of miss the flower crown.

847
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,500
-是吗 -是啊
- Oh, yeah? - Mm.

848
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,262
我也有点想念
I kind of miss the big green veil thing

849
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:27,020
你穿的那件绿色婚纱了
you had going on.

850
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,633
可以说 不是每个女孩都梦想着
Well, I can tell you it is not every girl's dream

851
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:31,980
被一个宇宙骗子利用情感玩过家家
to have a cosmic trickster play dress-up dolls

852
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,940
摆布她的情绪
with her emotions

853
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,273
还让她嫁错了人
and make her marry the wrong man.

854
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,920
这过去的四十八个小时
The last 48 hours have been...

855
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,160
罗杰
Roger.

856
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:42,580
我明白
I know.

857
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:46,017
我也一样
Me, too.

858
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,500
好了 我们就去跳舞吧
Now, let's go dance 

859
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,123
以后谁再也别提这事了
and never talk about this ever.

860
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:53,391
成交
Deal.

861
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,069
你和我想的一样吗
You thinking what I'm thinking?

862
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,739
但我们得处理得好才行
If we play our cards right.

863
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:08,272
噢 我们只是想和你说
Oh, we were just saying that an artist

864
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:09,779
这么才华横溢的艺术家
with such prodigious skills

865
00:45:09,779 --> 00:45:11,141
待在星站上真是大材小用了
shouldn't be confined to a starbase.

866
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:15,859
如果你的意思是想给我一个星舰上的岗位
If you're offering me a job on a starship,

867
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:17,500
我乐意效劳
my answer is yes.

868
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,051
谢谢
Thank you.

869
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:22,220
- 幸会幸会 - 谢谢
- Pleasure meeting you. - Thank you.

870
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,700
我刚刚与星际舰队公关部的负责人
I just had a very interesting conversation

871
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,456
进行了一次有趣的对谈
with the Chancellor of Starfleet's Public Relations.

872
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:27,180
是吗
Yeah?

873
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,400
他们有意向让我拍一部星际舰队的纪录片电影
They may commission a feature-length documentary of Starfleet.

874
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,019
那个负责人挺喜欢我
Well, the Chancellor likes me,

875
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:33,799
我可以跟他多美言几句
so I'll put in a good word.

876
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:36,560
你知道的 只要能烦到艾丽卡
You know, anything to annoy Erica.

877
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,480
我们要去烦艾丽卡吗
Shall we annoy Erica?

878
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,372
敬烦人的艾丽卡
To annoying Erica.

879
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,931
你刚刚的演讲可真精彩
That was a beautiful speech.

880
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:09,100
是的 大概吧
Yes. I suppose so.

881
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:13,640
爱有万千形态 史波克先生
Love comes in all forms, Mr. Spock,

882
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:16,041
而你给了她属于你的那份
and you gave her yours.

883
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:20,846
我并不后悔
And I have no regrets.

884
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,080
但努力到头来 还是付诸东流了
Still, it is a waste.

885
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,285
什么努力
What is?

886
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,887
你最近的时间都花在学习跳舞上了
Well, you spent all this time learning to dance,

887
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:29,980
结果你现在光坐着
and now you're just

888
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,456
啥都不用
sitting on it.

889
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:34,792
毕竟 你的肩膀位置都已经
After all, your shoulder placement

890
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,295
精确测量好了 不是吗
has been measured precisely, has it not?

891
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:40,065
如果我没记错的话
If I'm not mistaken,

892
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:42,360
你说不需要精确测量
I am not supposed to measure them.

893
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,768
我该让它们顺其自然
I am supposed to let them flow.

894
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:47,037
上尉
Lieutenant...

895
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:48,700
你是在邀请我共舞吗
are you asking me to dance?
