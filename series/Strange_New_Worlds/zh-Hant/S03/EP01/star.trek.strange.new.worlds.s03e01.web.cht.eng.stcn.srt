1
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,980
《星際迷航: 新世界》前情提要
Previously on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds...

2
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,340
向在通訊範圍內的所有聯邦星艦求救
To any Federation vessels in range, need help.

3
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,140
遭遇戈恩人襲擊
Under attack by the Gorn.

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,300
如今星際聯邦和戈恩霸權的關係非常緊張
The Federation's at a dangerous point in our relationship with the Gorn Hegemony.

5
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,250
這看起來像是一條分界線
It looks like a demarcation line.

6
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,040
帕納索斯貝塔星和他們所有的武裝力量
With Parnassus Beta and all their forces

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,080
在這條線的另一邊
on the far side of the line.

8
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,770
不幸的是 我認為我們的人
Unfortunately, that is where

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,170
被關押在那裡
I believe our people are being held.

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,080
我不打算丟下他們不管
I don't plan on leaving them behind.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,740
如果我頭腦裡藏著的東西是拯救進取號的答案
If somewhere in my head is the answer to saving the Enterprise,

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,870
那我必須冒這個險
then that's a risk I have to take.

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,980
拿著這個
Take this.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,760
它能幫你藏起來
It'll help you hide.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,280
快跑
Run!

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,840
在下蒙哥馬利·斯考特
Montgomery Scott at your service.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,450
你怎麼還活著
How are you not dead?

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,560
我知道如何隱藏在眾目睽睽之下
Well, I figured out how to hide in plain sight.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,540
你造了個戈恩人的應答器嗎
You built a Gorn transponder?

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,940
總的來說 對於掃描儀而言
Eh, basically, to a scanner,

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,630
我們的穿梭機看起來像是戈恩飛船
the shuttle looked like a Gorn ship.

22
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,820
你還能再造一個類似之前的設備嗎
Could you build another device like the one you made?

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,980
發生什麼了
What's happening?

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,360
巴特爾艦長需要馬上注射鎮定劑
Captain Batel is in need of immediate sedation.

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,320
昨天發生的
Happened yesterday.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,030
我不會放棄她的
I'm not giving up on her.

27
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,340
我也沒那個打算
I have no intention of doing that.

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,100
艦長 傳送機目前在星球表面上未探測到任何人
Captain, the transporter is not currently picking up anyone on the surface.

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,820
艾普里爾上將命令我們馬上撤離
Admiral April's ordering our immediate withdrawal.

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,260
殖民地居民和外勤隊
The colonists and the landing party

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,060
顯然被傳送到了
appear to have been beamed up

32
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,920
戈恩人的船上
by the Gorn.

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,000
艦長 請下令
Orders, Captain?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,140
現在 即將揭曉結局
And now, the conclusion.

35
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,540
艦長 請下令
Orders, Captain?

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,470
護盾只剩50%了
Shields at 50%.

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,990
艦長
Captain.

38
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,430
艦長 請下令
Orders, Captain?

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,820
烏乎拉 再重複一下上將剛剛的命令
Uhura, repeat April's last order.

40
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,730
撤退 並且
Retreat and rendez...

41
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,320
撤退並與艦隊匯合 艦長
Retreat and rendezvous with the fleet, sir.

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,600
他給了坐標
He gave coordinates.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,880
但他沒說要立即會合 對吧
But he didn't say immediately?

44
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,500
行了 各位有什麼點子嗎
All right, who's got ideas?

45
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,440
聲東擊西
Diversionary tactics.

46
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,660
我們被圍困得太厲害了
We're too boxed in.

47
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,160
排空曲速艙 製造一片等離子云團?
Vent the nacelles, create a cloud?

48
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,620
那我們自己也看不見了
We need to be able to see.

49
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,450
干擾敵方的通訊
Jam their comms

50
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,930
使其無法協調攻擊
so they can't coordinate attacks.

51
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,320
對 就是這個
That's it. That's the one.

52
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,800
戈恩人使用光信號作為艦對艦通訊手段
The Gorn use light for ship-to-ship messaging.

53
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,920
我正在調整偏導陣列來發射光譜
I'm modulating the deflector array to emit a spectrum.

54
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,200
應該能迷惑他們一陣
Should confuse them for a bit.

55
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,990
好 現在想想要怎麼把自己人傳送回來
All right, now how do we beam our people back to Enterprise?

56
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,280
掃描顯示戈恩星艦能夠阻斷傳送
Scans indicate the Gorn ships are transport-resistant.

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,440
所以即便我們繞過了護盾
So, even if we get past the shields,

58
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,620
也需要授權碼才行
we need authorization codes.

59
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,760
沒時間去破解密碼了
No time to hack codes.

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,240
先撤再救
Retreat and rescue.

61
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,940
這是一堆爛選項裡最好的了
It's the best of a bunch of bad options.

62
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,400
那我們要怎樣追蹤一艘
So how do we track this specific ship

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,830
跨越數光年的船呢
across light-years of space?

64
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,420
沃凱礦 一種稀有元素
Wolkite. A rare element

65
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,140
含有子空間規範玻色子
that contains subspace gauge bosons.

66
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,660
如果我們調整一個定位信標
If we modified a homing beacon...

67
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,880
戈恩人遠遠地就能看到信標飛過來
The Gorn would see a beacon coming from a mile away.

68
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,080
如果是魚雷就不會
Not if it's a torpedo.

69
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,180
我們對他們發射一顆啞彈
We tag 'em with a dud.

70
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,420
戈恩人猜不到我們要幹什麼
The Gorn won't know what we're up to.

71
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,410
護盾只剩30%了
Shields at 30%.

72
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,220
要想這個方法奏效 我們仍需穿透
For this to succeed, we still need to penetrate

73
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,480
戈恩星艦的護盾系統
the Gorn's defensive systems.

74
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,220
我們已經用上了所有武器攻擊他們
We've been hitting them with everything we've got,

75
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,070
沒多大用
it doesn't do much.

76
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,380
能量護盾基於諧波運作
Uh, energy shields work on harmonics.

77
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,120
如果我們找對頻率
If we find the right frequency...

78
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,510
我們可以撞擊敵艦
We can ram the ship.

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,600
確實
Indeed.

80
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,560
我們的護盾和他們的接觸時
When our shields make contact with theirs,

81
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,300
兩列諧波疊加時會出現相消干涉現象
they will create a destructive interference pattern

82
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,340
並在短時間內中斷這兩個頻率的護盾
and momentarily interrupt both frequencies.

83
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,280
沒有護盾 我們就是活靶子
With our shields down, we'd be sitting ducks.

84
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,400
那我們就只有一次機會
We'd only have one shot.

85
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,040
這就足夠了
That's all we need.

86
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,220
米歇爾 調轉方向
Mitchell, bring us around,

87
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,600
與敵方驅逐艦正面交火
head-to-head with the destroyer.

88
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,400
是時候來點硬碰硬了
Time to play a game of chicken.

89
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,720
全艦注意 做好衝擊準備
All decks, prepare for impact.

90
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,460
隨時可讓脈衝引擎全速推進 艦長
Full impulse on your orders, Captain.

91
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,810
讓慣性阻尼器最大功率運行
Inertial dampeners to maximum.

92
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,340
所有人 抓穩扶好了
Everybody hold onto something.

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,760
烏娜
Una...

94
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,920
動手吧
let's hit it.

95
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,440
發射魚雷
Fire torpedoes.

96
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,660
舵手 曲速帶離
Helm, warp us out of here.

97
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,520
遵命
On it.

98
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,490
堅持住 各位
Hang in there, guys.

99
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,620
艦長 我們已到達會合點
Captain, we've arrived at the rendezvous point.

100
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,310
聯邦星艦巴勃羅·畢加索號在聯絡我們
The USS Pablo Picasso is hailing to greet us.

101
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,020
是艾普里爾上將 艦長
It's Admiral April, sir.

102
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,740
他現在要傳送上艦聽取匯報
He's beaming aboard now to debrief.

103
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,520
還要打針嗎
More needles?

104
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,860
沒錯 得再來幾針
Yes, just a few more pokes.

105
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,280
沒有這些
I mean, without these,

106
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,500
你的身體會在靜滯場裡面壞死 所以
your body will go necrotic in the stasis field, so...

107
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,020
你會變紫 會很難看
Things turn purple. It's not pretty.

108
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,440
我從沒被凍結冬眠過
I've never been frozen solid before.

109
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,590
這前景不怎麼激動人心
It's not an exciting prospect.

110
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,770
沒事 等我們解決了這小小的戈恩卵感染問題
Well, as soon as we work out this little Gorn infection,

111
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,810
你就又能活蹦亂跳的了
you'll be up and around again.

112
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,860
（* 原文是指小說《瑞普·凡·溫克爾》裡主人公一覺睡了二十年 醒來發現世界已經天翻地覆）

113
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,860
感覺我會像小說裡瑞普*那樣 一醒來發現一切都變了
So this could be like a Rip Van Winkle thing for me.

114
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,430
我覺得你更會像是睡美人
I see you more as a Sleeping Beauty.

115
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,910
聽著 我之前說的是認真的
Listen, I meant what I said before.

116
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,170
一旦那時要在我和其他船員之間做出選擇
The moment it looks like me or the crew,

117
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,220
就犧牲掉我
you take me out.

118
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,780
不要想這些了
Don't think about that.

119
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,530
靜滯狀態會阻止你和戈恩胚胎
Stasis will prevent you and the Gorn

120
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,820
進行任何形式的細胞生長
from any type of cellular growth.

121
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,700
做好最壞的打算
There's another side to the coin.

122
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,320
無論代價如何
Whatever it takes.

123
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,410
無論代價如何 我保證
Whatever it takes. I promise.

124
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,190
我現在要給你注射鎮靜劑了
I'm, uh, I'm gonna give you a sedative now.

125
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,330
等你醒來 戈恩感染的問題就治好了
And when you wake up, you will be Gorn-free.

126
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,090
腎上腺素和中和劑 快
Epinephrine and neutralizer, stat!

127
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,440
她的身體正在排斥血清
Her body's rejecting the serum.

128
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,000
醫務室呼叫艦橋
Sickbay to bridge.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,620
有個最新消息 情況不太樂觀
Uh, I have an update, and it's not good.

130
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,620
告訴我最壞情況
Bottom line it for me.

131
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,900
巴特爾艦長對低溫血清過敏
Captain Batel is allergic to cryoserum.

132
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,060
我們不能把她放進靜滯狀態
We can't put her in stasis.

133
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,260
那她的生命已經進入倒計時了嗎
So she's back on a ticking clock?

134
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,220
她身體裡的戈恩卵會在
The Gorn will hatch from her body in, um...

135
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,780
一天之內孵化
in less than a day.

136
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,510
我正在努力尋找治療的方法
I'm stuck trying to find a treatment.

137
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,160
但是
Um... uh...

138
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,330
也許如果約瑟夫在這裡 就可以
maybe if Joseph was here, I could...

139
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,440
我會派人去幫忙
I'm sending help.

140
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,800
克莉絲汀
Christine...

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,040
我相信你
I believe in you.

142
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,160
救救她
Help her.

143
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,700
我會盡我所能 艦長
I'll do my best, Captain.

144
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,580
艦長 我或許不是醫生
Captain, I may not be a doctor,

145
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,900
但我能夠把我所有的能力都奉獻在巴特爾艦長的治療上
but I will dedicate all of my abilities to Captain Batel

146
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,100
直到解決她的戈恩卵感染
until her Gorn infection is... resolved.

147
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,940
就只是看著?
Just stand by?

148
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,720
你可是有一整支艦隊在待命啊
You have the entire fleet out there ready to go.

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,470
這是力量展示
It's a show of force.

150
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,400
我們先要建立起有效的巡邏
First we need to establish patrols.

151
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,820
他們真這麼覺得嗎
Do they really think

152
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,960
覺得戈恩人只要炸完這些殖民地
the Gorn are just gonna stop and go home

153
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,060
就會收手然後回家?
after they raided those colonies?

154
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,880
好吧 這是很棘手的情況
Look, it's a tough situation,

155
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
但我們必須一次解決一個問題
but we have to manage it one piece at a time.

156
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,400
無數無辜生命正危在旦夕 鮑勃
There are innocent lives at stake, Bob.

157
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,310
我明白
And I get that.

158
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,520
但這件事發生在我們的管轄範圍之外
But it's happening outside of our jurisdiction.

159
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,080
拜託 鮑勃
Oh, come on, Bob.

160
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,520
除了你那不怕死的狗斗之外
Apart from your reckless dogfight,

161
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,820
這些攻擊和聯邦並沒有關係
these attacks do not involve the Federation.

162
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,480
我們有規定的 克里斯
We have regulations, Chris.

163
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,230
所以 就因為死的不是聯邦公民
So, because it's non-Federation citizens that are dying,

164
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,200
我們就作壁上觀嗎
we do nothing?

165
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,020
我們對於聯邦成員國都有義務在身
We have an obligation to our member worlds.

166
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,940
那可是數十億人
Billions of lives.

167
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,400
現在就貿然投入戰爭
To rush into a fight right now

168
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,160
會將所有人都置於危險當中
puts all of them at risk.

169
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,060
我們不能這樣
We can't do it.

170
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,460
我們還沒從克林貢戰爭中完全恢復
We're still recovering from the Klingon War.

171
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,040
你說得一點沒錯
You are absolutely right,

172
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,020
戈恩就是利用這一點發動進攻
and the Gorn sense our weakness.

173
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,760
我們現在是獵物
We are prey.

174
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
他們只會把這條霸權的邊境線
They will push this Hegemony line

175
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,640
向著聯邦領空內部推得越來越深
further and further into Federation space.

176
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,730
你也知道他們會這麼做
And you know they will.

177
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,980
等到我們真的恢復過來
And by the time we actually get around

178
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,220
有精力反制的時候
to doing something about it...

179
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,980
一切就太晚了
it'll be way too late.

180
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,140
我聽說了外勤隊的事
I heard about the landing party.

181
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,880
對啊 還有幾百號殖民地居民呢
Yeah, and a couple hundred colonists, too.

182
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,920
瑪麗呢
And Marie?

183
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,380
她在醫務室裡
She's in sickbay.

184
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,960
官方地說 給你的命令是監控分界線
Officially, your orders are to monitor the demarcation line

185
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,480
避免戈恩人的進一步進犯
for any encroachment by the Gorn.

186
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,210
好 那不官方的呢
Okay. And unofficially?

187
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,910
為何不給他們點顏色看看 告訴他們我們不是獵物
How do we punch back and show them we aren't prey?

188
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,740
行 我接受這個
Yeah, I can do that.

189
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,340
你做的這個裝置
This contraption of yours,

190
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,920
你再說一遍它是幹什麼的
what's it supposed to do again?

191
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,260
發射極化電磁信號
Emit a polarized EM signature that

192
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,280
誘騙戈恩 讓它們以為我們是他們中的一員
tricks the Gorn into thinking we're one of them.

193
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,710
類似隱身裝置的原理
It's like a cloaking device.

194
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,340
那麼它究竟是怎麼做到這一點的
And how, exactly, does it do that?

195
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,740
說實話 我不太記得了
Ah, if I'm being honest, I don't really remember.

196
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,000
我就是當時靈機一動
I was kind of in the moment.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,110
很好 那我現在要問一個很蠢的問題
Well, now I'm going to ask a silly question,

198
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,240
而且我確定我知道答案
to which I'm pretty sure I know the answer.

199
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,110
別又來這個
Not this again.

200
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,630
就像回到了報告廳一樣
It's like being back in lecture hall.

201
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,500
你怎麼知道 你又沒去過報告廳
How would you know that? You were never there.

202
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,180
我去過 在後排而已
I was there, in the back.

203
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,340
你在把這堆東西拼起來時
Did you record a work-in-progress log

204
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,960
有沒有記工作日誌
while you were jury-rigging this up?

205
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,560
啥 您的意思是在戈恩人正在轟炸我的時候記錄?
What, you mean as the Gorn were tearing our ship apart?

206
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,500
斯考特 工程學第一定律就是寫下來
First rule in engineering, Scotty: write it down.

207
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,430
我們被要求無論什麼情況下
There's a reason we track our work

208
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,780
都要記錄自己的工作是有理由的
no matter what the circumstance, and this,

209
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,910
現在的這個情況 就是最好的理由
this right now, this is precisely the reason.

210
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,830
抱歉打斷
Pardon the interruption.

211
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,400
你們還要多久能讓這東西恢復運作
How long before you get that working?

212
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,920
哦 派克艦長 問題是
Oh, Captain Pike, the thing is,

213
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,560
它在我的小穿梭機上能起作用
it worked on my wee shuttle,

214
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,220
但進取號就
but the Enterprise is...

215
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,160
那您什麼時候需要它呢 艦長
How soon do you need it, Captain?

216
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,640
我們正在航向戈恩的領空
We're headed into Gorn space,

217
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,500
所以現在能用就最好了
so now would be good.

218
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,840
在我們跨過分界線之前它會準備好的
It'll be up and working before we cross the Hegemony line.

219
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,580
我希望如此 因為我和船上所有人的命都指望在它身上了
I'm counting on it, as are the lives of everyone on board.

220
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,630
不管有沒有這個裝置
We're going after our missing crew,

221
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,760
我們都要去搜救被抓走的船員
with or without that device.

222
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,340
明白了嗎
Understand?

223
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,260
哇 還真是一點壓力都沒有呢
Well, that's no pressure.

224
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,120
媽媽
Mom?

225
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,860
拉安 勇敢點
La'An, be brave.

226
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,320
對危險沒有畏懼之心才會置你於死地
Not believing you're gonna die is what gets you killed.

227
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,150
那是戈恩人
It's the Gorn.

228
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,500
醒醒
Wake up.

229
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,720
快醒醒
Wake up!

230
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,420
你能做到的
You can do this.

231
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,300
第一個倒霉的總是醫生
Always start with the doctor.

232
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,020
好了
Okay.

233
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,960
我的媽 我的手
Holy crap, my hand!

234
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,440
我他媽的半隻手都沒了
Half my hand is frickin' gone.

235
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,220
艾麗卡 看著我
Erica, look at me.

236
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,700
看著我 冷靜下來
Look at me. Relax.

237
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,390
會沒事的
It's going to be okay.

238
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,350
只要我們能回到船上就能治好它
We can fix this when we get back to the ship.

239
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,400
拜託
Please.

240
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,540
先保持冷靜
Try to stay calm.

241
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,400
好吧
Okay.

242
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,880
但怎麼
How?

243
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,060
我們怎麼才能回到船上
How do we get back to the ship?

244
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,890
而且他們怎麼辦
What about them?

245
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,300
如果我們一次只能解救一個人
If we free them one at a time,

246
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,720
那我們能救出來的人屈指可數
we'll only get a handful out.

247
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,360
如果能的話
If that.

248
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,140
光是我們四個人脫困就花了這麼久
Look how long it took for the four of us to get loose.

249
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,340
這是一個巨大的消化腔
This is a massive digestive chamber.

250
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,380
而且它正在消化
And it's working its way through...

251
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,780
看起來像是燃料加工廠
looks like a-a processing plant for fuel.

252
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,620
或者只是戈恩人的食物工廠
Or just food for the Gorn.

253
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,920
我真的不想變成哪個戈恩人的盤中餐
I don't like the idea of being anyone's lunch.

254
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,940
即便我們能夠喚醒他們
And even if we can wake them up,

255
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,830
不管是一個還是一百個
one or a hundred,

256
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,230
我們還是沒法離開這個
we still don't have a way out of...

257
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,060
不知道什麼的地方
wherever this is.

258
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,700
先一步一步來吧
One step at a time.

259
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,240
要是什麼都不做 就是等死
Sitting here doing nothing is a death sentence.

260
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,200
而且搞不好
And for all we know,

261
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,670
那些戈恩人可能在我們醒來那會就被驚動了
the Gorn were alerted the moment that we woke up.

262
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,580
所以那些殺人蜥蜴可能已經在來的路上了
So the killer lizards could already be on their way.

263
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,320
他們來了
They're coming.

264
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,060
別害怕
Don't be afraid.

265
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,460
拉安
La'An.

266
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,850
無論發生什麼
No matter what.

267
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,780
拉安
La'An.

268
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,470
上尉 你在想什麼
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?

269
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,520
你說得對
You're right.

270
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,650
不僅僅關乎我們自己
It's not just about us.

271
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,260
這些殖民地居民很快也會被殺害
All of these people will be dead soon.

272
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,780
看這
Hey.

273
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,740
這看起來像個排泄樁
This looks like an evacuation pile.

274
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,280
也許 這艘船不能處理的東西 都由它排出
Maybe whatever the ship can't process, it expels.

275
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,980
糞堆裡的武器
Weapons from a crap pile.

276
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,290
怪了 這個方向是對的
Strangely, it's a step in the right direction.

277
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,430
我不想只救下屈指可數的人
I don't want to save a handful of colonists,

278
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,990
我想拯救全部人
I want to save them all.

279
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,140
所有還活著的人 都能回家
Everyone that's still alive gets home.

280
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,040
即使這意味著 我們必須殺出一條血路
Even if we have to shoot our way out.

281
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,840
哎呀 你個蠢貨
Ack, bawheid.

282
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,920
不是這樣
That's not it.

283
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,420
是戈恩人 他們來了
They're here!

284
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,640
該死
Oh, shite.

285
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,340
我們完蛋了 斯考提
We're doomed. Scotty.

286
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,940
不不不不
No, no, no, no...

287
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,220
我們都死定了
We're all gonna die!

288
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,000
成功了
It's working.

289
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,480
快通知艦橋 把它加到護盾上
Tell the bridge to patch it to the shields.

290
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,550
怎麼 太晚了嗎
What? Is it too late?

291
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,320
艦橋呼叫科學實驗室 你們進展如何了
Bridge to science lab. What's the status down there?

292
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,800
我們馬上要進入戈恩領空了
We're about to enter Gorn space.

293
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,380
真是狡猾
Oh, you minx.

294
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,750
已經在正常運行了 艦長
It's up and running, Captain.

295
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,280
我們現在就能把它加到護盾上
We can patch it into the shields now.

296
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
好極了 派克完畢
Excellent. Pike out.

297
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
一點都不好笑
That wasn't funny.

298
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
明明就很有趣
It was fun.

299
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,560
你差點害我心臟病發作
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

300
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,490
我那麼做 是因為我了解你
I did it 'cause I know you.

301
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,740
你才不了解呢
No, you don't.

302
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,160
太了解了 平時閒得發慌的時候你就擺了
Yes, with too much time on your hands, you fall apart,

303
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,240
但要是有相位槍頂著你的頭 你立刻精神百倍
but put a phaser to your head and voilà.

304
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
你管我這麼多幹嘛
Why do you care what I do?

305
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,160
你防備太重了 斯考提
You put up walls, Scotty.

306
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,780
你太害怕承擔風險了
You're too afraid to take a risk.

307
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,840
我修好了你想讓我修的東西
I fixed what you wanted me to.

308
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,520
而且你相當目無上級
And you're insubordinate to boot.

309
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,420
準確來說你又不是我的上級
Well, technically you're not my C.O.

310
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,980
她在馭星號上犧牲了
She went down on the Stardiver.

311
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,470
我可以離開了嗎 長官
May I be excused, sir?

312
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,900
哦 斯考提
Oh, Scotty.

313
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,270
艦長 我們正在接近戈恩霸權領空邊境
Approaching the Hegemony demarcation line now, sir.

314
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,780
脫離曲速
Drop us out of warp.

315
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,240
開啟斯考特的應答器
Start Mr. Scott's transponder.

316
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,140
應答器?
Transponder?

317
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,720
佩利亞說它更像是一個改裝過的電磁脈衝發射器
Pelia says it's more like a modified EM pulse emitter.

318
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,330
好吧 那就說得通了
Okay, then that makes sense.

319
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,500
戈恩人肯定不使用光學數據
The Gorn must not use optical data.

320
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,080
他們已經進化了
They've evolved,

321
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,380
所以他們一定依賴生物識別信息
so they must rely on biometrics,

322
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,620
熱量和電磁信號
heat and EM signatures.

323
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,850
嗯 是時候看看這到底能不能成功了
Well, time to see if it actually works.

324
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,880
我的意思是 它應該可以
It should. I mean,

325
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,900
除非哪個戈恩人突然決定看一眼窗外
unless maybe one of them decides to look out a window.

326
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,690
艦長 戈恩狩獵艦正在接近
Captain, Gorn hunters approaching.

327
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,430
保持穩定航線
Keep us steady and on course.

328
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,680
目前為止 我沒看到任何窗戶
So far, I don't see any windows.

329
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,180
它奏效了
It worked.

330
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,370
烏乎拉 我們還能接收到沃凱礦信標的信號嗎
Uhura, do we still have a signal from the wolkite beacon?

331
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,940
是的 艦長
Aye, sir.

332
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,540
信號很弱且在逐漸減弱 但它還在發射信號
It's faint and getting weaker but still there.

333
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,160
有關於他們去向的情報嗎
Any intel on where they're headed?

334
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,500
一個未知的雙星系統
An uncharted binary star system.

335
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,360
那裡的恆星活動
The stellar activity there

336
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,250
是我們前所未見的
is like nothing we've ever seen before.

337
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,340
舵手 設置航線
Helm, plot a course.

338
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,700
艦長 那個星系的輻射高得超出量表
Captain, the radiation in that system is off the charts.

339
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,400
到最後 我們只能使用脈衝引擎
At a certain point, we can only use impulse engines,

340
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,480
進取號的護盾也無法抵擋輻射了
and our shields won't be able to protect us.

341
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,720
了解 那我們快速行動
Understood. We'll make it quick.

342
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,000
米歇爾 曲速七級
Mitchell, warp factor seven.

343
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,040
遵命 艦長
Aye aye, sir.

344
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,410
有趣
Intriguing.

345
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,860
戈恩卵的孵化進程大幅改變了她身體的生物化學結構
The incubation has severely altered her biochemistry.

346
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,960
她的身體現在依賴於戈恩的幼體
Her body is now as dependent

347
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,580
就像戈恩幼體依賴於她
on the Gorn hatchlings as they are on her.

348
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,760
完美的宿主 不可分割
The perfect host, inseparable.

349
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,460
你試過顯微減瘤術了嗎
Have you tried microscopic debulking?

350
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,860
模擬完畢
Results completed.

351
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,550
這是我最後跑的一次模擬
It's the last simulation I ran.

352
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,860
死亡率為100%
Probability of fatality is 100%.

353
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,080
我做的每一次模擬 結果全都一樣
That's the chorus of the day. It's every simulation I've run.

354
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,950
計算機 模擬顯微減瘤術的情境
Computer, run scenarios for microscopic debulking

355
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,060
將注射扎多拉提取物納入模擬變量中
factoring for an infusion of Zadora extract.

356
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,420
正在處理
Processing.

357
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,160
獵戶星的街頭毒品?
An Orion street drug?

358
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,830
實話說 這真是天才想法
Actually, that's kind of brilliant.

359
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,200
是你教會了我跳出框架去看
You are the one who taught me to look outside of the box.

360
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,280
是「去思考」
It's "think,"

361
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,580
但也差不多
but close enough.

362
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,190
克莉絲汀
Christine.

363
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,560
我知道你想談談
I know you want to talk.

364
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,520
我會盡量簡短
I will be brief.

365
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,070
我只是想為你離開前
I simply want to apologize

366
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,590
我們之間的結局道個歉
for the way things ended before you left.

367
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,290
我當時情緒有點失控
I reacted poorly.

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,720
好了
Apology accepted.

369
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,070
原諒你了
We're good.

370
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,950
失去你的念頭
The thought of losing you,

371
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,950
深深困擾著我
it affected me deeply.

372
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,780
我理解
I understand.

373
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,660
事情變得複雜了
This has gotten complicated,

374
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,220
我不擅長應對複雜
and I am not good at complicated.

375
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,000
而我還是要離開三個月
And I am still going away for three months

376
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,010
去和羅傑·科爾比一起學習
to study with Roger Korby.

377
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,620
等我回來 再看看我們的狀態吧
When I get back, let's just see where we are then.

378
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,490
所以你是想說
So you are saying that perhaps

379
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,010
也許分開一段時間 對我們有好處嗎
some time apart might be good for us?

380
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,410
史波克
Spock.

381
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,420
是的
Yeah.

382
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,980
但不是說
But not like...

383
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,550
作為我們倆的我們
not like "us" us.

384
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,590
只是說
Like...

385
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,770
作為兩個個體的我們
us as people.

386
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,210
請別做那些你覺得浪漫的事
Please don't do something you think is romantic,

387
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,080
像是等我之類的
like wait for me or something.

388
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,140
扎多拉提取物情境模擬完畢
Zadora extract scenario completed.

389
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,140
死亡率為100%
Probability of fatality is 100%.

390
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,870
無論我們用什麼方法
No matter how we approach this,

391
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,960
巴特爾的人類基因
Batel's human DNA is...

392
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,310
都存在不足
Inadequate.

393
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,440
她的身體進入休克狀態
Her body goes into shock,

394
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,460
血壓開始下降
blood pressure drops.

395
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,400
最後死亡
And she dies.

396
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,320
哼 人類的身體始終有限
Huh. Human physiology.

397
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,800
但如果我們給她的基因幫點忙呢
What if we gave her some help there?

398
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,200
你已經有主意了
You have an idea.

399
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,810
伊勒利亞人的基因
Illyrian DNA.

400
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,260
烏娜的血液
Una's blood,

401
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,880
基因使其可以實時抵抗感染
it's designed to combat infections in real time.

402
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,440
一劑血清可以給巴特爾的免疫系統來一次大升級
A plasma injection could provide a boost to Batel's immunity.

403
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,550
這樣我們就能在不使其休克的前提下
And we could attempt the surgery

404
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,860
嘗試進行手術了
without her going into shock.

405
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,900
這樣做違反規定
It is against regulation,

406
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,100
但能挽救她的生命
but it could save her life.

407
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,040
計算機 模擬手術結果
Computer, run scenario for surgery

408
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,360
將注射伊勒利亞血清納入模擬變量中
factoring for a plasma transfusion from an Illyrian blood donor.

409
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,000
處理中
Processing.

410
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,390
你當時是怎麼說的來著
How did you put it once?

411
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,830
有些規則就是用來打破的?
Some rules are intended to be broken?

412
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,090
幾乎準確無誤了
Almost exactly it.

413
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,820
這就是機庫
There's the hangar.

414
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,840
好吧
Okay.

415
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,140
大家都了解計劃吧
Everyone's clear on the plan?

416
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,700
訪問這艘船的計算機主機
Access the ship's mainframe,

417
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,380
上傳戈恩星艦的傳送器密碼
upload the Gorn transporter codes...

418
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,190
把他們帶回進取號
Get them to the Enterprise.

419
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,820
要成功 我們必須偷一艘飛船 從這裡飛出去
To do that, we have to steal a ship and fly it out of here.

420
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,820
這個看起來沒什麼警戒措施
That one doesn't look guarded.

421
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,460
我們超有把握 一點都不是不可能任務
Totally got this, not impossible at all.

422
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,940
你什麼都能飛 是真的吧
And it's true you can fly anything, right?

423
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,680
別這麼沒禮貌 當然是真的
Don't be rude. Of course I can.

424
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,000
好
Okay.

425
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,430
來搞定那艘飛船吧
Let's get to that ship.

426
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,690
這是個好計劃
This is a good plan.

427
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,640
一定行得通
It's gonna work.

428
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,130
這是個好計劃
It's good. It's-it's...

429
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,880
是個好計劃 對嗎
It's a good plan, right?

430
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,350
當然了
It's a good plan.

431
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,180
沒錯 我們現在只需要
Yeah. Yeah. Now all we have to do is

432
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,270
別被戈恩人逮住
not get caught by the Gorn.

433
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,380
山姆
Sam.

434
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,230
你為啥要烏鴉嘴
Why would you say that?

435
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,180
不是姐們 這你也能怪我啊
What? Oh, come on, you can't blame me.

436
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,020
相位槍調到擊殺檔
Phasers to kill.

437
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,930
該走了
Time to go.

438
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,860
我和烏乎拉一直在鑽研
Uhura and I have been poring over

439
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,640
手頭能得到的戈恩人數據
all available data on the Gorn.

440
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,000
確認的襲擊 未被證實的目擊
Confirmed attacks, unverified sightings.

441
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,380
如果可能和戈恩人有關係 我們就檢查過一遍
If it might be a Gorn, we've checked it out.

442
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,640
比我們想像的信息多出很多
And there's a lot more out there than we thought.

443
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,520
你得稍微用點想像力
You have to squint a little.

444
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,950
但是每一次戈恩目擊事件
But every Gorn sighting correlates

445
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,260
都和某個特定的恆星活動規律正相關
to a pattern of specific stellar events.

446
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,360
日冕物質拋射
Coronal mass ejections.

447
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,560
我已經了解過了
I know this already, CMEs.

448
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,660
恆星耀斑爆發會引發強烈恆星風
Stellar flares can set off a frenzy.

449
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,610
是的 其活動遵循一定的規律
Yes, the attacks follow a pattern,

450
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,090
戈恩人的休眠也是如此
but so does Gorn inactivity.

451
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,270
這都是烏乎拉發現的
Uhura is the one who found it.

452
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,790
我們知道有很長一段時間
There are long periods of time

453
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,670
沒有任何戈恩人活動的報告
where no Gorn activity is reported.

454
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,320
甚至連一點風聲都沒有
Not so much as a rumor.

455
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,100
在那個時間段
And in those instances,

456
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,100
獨特的恆星活動似乎觸發了某些東西
there's unique stellar activity that seems to trigger...

457
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,000
休眠
Hibernation.

458
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,890
沒錯
Yes.

459
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,160
我們認為戈恩人有著漫長的休眠週期
We believe that the Gorn have a long hibernation cycle.

460
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,340
在適當的條件下 它們會變得溫順
Under the right conditions, they become docile.

461
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,180
我們可以利用這一點
We can use that.

462
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,900
我們的科學團隊協助了計算
The science team chipped in on the math

463
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,420
成功識別出X級太陽耀斑及其伴隨的上弓下沉流
and was able to isolate the presence of X-class flares

464
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,730
兩者在消失前均有明顯前兆
and supra-arcade downflows that precede their absence.

465
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,080
做的好 你們倆
Good work, both of you.

466
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,820
還有一點
There's something else.

467
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,200
數據表明
The data also suggests that

468
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,260
我們可能正處於戈恩人長期侵略行為的初期
we could be at the beginning of a long cycle of Gorn aggression.

469
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,580
這些襲擊可能預示著
These attacks could signal what

470
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,570
戈恩人即將發動全面入侵
could soon be a full-scale Gorn invasion.

471
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,360
艦長 我們將在兩分鐘後脫離曲速
Dropping out of warp in two minutes, sir.

472
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,060
謝謝你 米歇爾 我們這就來
Thank you, Mitchell. On our way.

473
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,060
史波克和查普爾知道自己在做什麼
Spock and Chapel know what they're doing.

474
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,960
我相信他們
I trust them

475
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,810
會好好利用我的血液
with a couple liters of my blood.

476
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,120
謝謝你
Thank you for that.

477
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,080
他們說這可能是她唯一的機會
They say it may be her only hope.

478
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,620
為了瑪麗 他們需要什麼我都願意提供
For Marie, they can take all they want.

479
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,200
這次任務不留存記錄
This mission's already off-the-record,

480
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,780
所以也沒什麼好報告的
so nothing to report.

481
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,650
克里斯
Chris,

482
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,830
聽一聽你自己的建議吧
take some of your own advice.

483
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,090
要抱有希望
Focus on hope.

484
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,480
伊勒利亞血液供給方案已完成
Illyrian blood donor scenario completed.

485
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,190
死亡概率為86%
Probability of fatality: 86%.

486
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,700
只有這個方案能讓她有一線生機
That's the first one that's given her any chance at all.

487
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,260
雖然成功率也不高
Albeit not a very high one.

488
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,140
按理說 不能在這種概率下進行手術
I mean, we can't do the surgery with these odds.

489
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,850
但總算有所進展了 我們繼續努力
We're on to something. Let's keep at it.

490
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,480
好的
Indeed.

491
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,730
我們已接近輻射區
We're near the radiation zone.

492
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,990
從現在起 只能使用脈衝引擎
From here on, it's impulse engines only.

493
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,480
米歇爾 你連續工作很久了
Mitchell, you've been running nonstop.

494
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,580
去換班吧
Call for relief.

495
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,570
恕我直言 在把所有人都救回來前
With respect, I'm not leaving the station

496
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,220
我絕不離開崗位
until we get everyone back.

497
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,750
明白了
Copy.

498
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,580
謝謝你
Thank you.

499
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,320
我收到了沃凱礦的信號
I have the wolkite signature.

500
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,060
即將接近敵方驅逐艦
We're coming up on the enemy destroyer.

501
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,200
我們多久能追上他們
How soon can we overtake them?

502
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,460
克里斯 我們可能來晚了
Chris, we may be too late.

503
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,890
他們已經進入了輻射區
They've already entered the radiation zone.

504
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,840
如果我們繼續深入當前星系
If we go any deeper into this star system,

505
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,300
全體船員都將陷入危險
we put the entire crew at risk.

506
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,420
舵手 立即停船
Helm, full stop.

507
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,080
主屏幕切換為遠距離觀測畫面
Put the long-range visual up on the main screen.

508
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,250
是我的錯覺 還是
Is it me, or does it look like

509
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,820
那艘船確實正朝著恆星的方向行駛?
that ship is going to fly right into that star?

510
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,940
我也看到了 簡直難以置信
I see it, I don't believe it.

511
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,390
遙測數據已確認 艦長
Telemetry confirms, Captain.

512
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,620
我們必須做點什麼
We have to do something.

513
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,340
你看
Look.

514
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,700
他們是失去動力了嗎
Did they just lose power?

515
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,010
不是
No.

516
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,530
我認為他們是故意的
I think it was intentional.

517
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,620
但為什麼呢
But why?

518
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,500
將全部備用能量傳輸至護盾
All auxiliary power to the shields.

519
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,080
盡可能爭取在輻射區停留的時間
Give me as much time as possible inside that radiation zone.

520
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,380
我們追上去
We're going after 'em.

521
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,650
新一輪日冕物質拋射活動逼近
We've got another CME flare coming.

522
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,700
她快不行了
She's coding.

523
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,900
戈恩幼體正在孵化
The Gorn hatchlings are activating.

524
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,200
有什麼東西加速了它們的生長
Something has accelerated their growth.

525
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,790
14%的成功率總比注定的死亡要好
A 14% chance of survival is better than certain death.

526
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,980
準備手術吧
Let's prep her for surgery.

527
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,380
我還能接收到沃凱礦的信號
I'm still getting a ping on the wolkite signal.

528
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,940
我們必須盡我們所能拯救我們的船員
We need to get to our people while we still can.

529
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,160
這裡的磁場干擾讓導航系統無法運作
The magnetic fields here make navigation impossible.

530
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,600
這就解釋了戈恩星艦為何會像失去動力一樣
That explains why the Gorn go into a free fall.

531
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,560
他們利用了強重力井來完成大部分機動
They let the intense gravity wells do most of the work.

532
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,470
星際艦隊方面沒有回覆
No response from Starfleet.

533
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,300
都是因為這些輻射
It's all the radiation.

534
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,880
無論是進取號還是雙星系統以外的區域
And no visuals on the ship

535
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,000
都無法獲得影像反饋
or what's beyond the binary stars.

536
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,910
這種光線折射方式會生成一種自然全息投影
The light bends in a way that creates a natural hologram.

537
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,060
一旦穿過它 就無法被看到了
They're essentially invisible once they pass through it.

538
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,180
形成了絕佳的防禦屏障
Makes for a great defense system.

539
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,010
也許那是一種降落程序
Maybe it's a landing sequence.

540
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,700
有沒有可能 戈恩母星就在這
Could this be the Gorn homeworld?

541
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,230
如果假設成立 那這就是他們回母星的方法
If it is, that's how they go back to it.

542
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,600
艦長
Captain,

543
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,900
外面有情況
something's moving out there.

544
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,600
屏顯
On screen.

545
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,490
一號
Number One.

546
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,720
我計算了他們的軌跡
I've plotted their trajectory.

547
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,830
那些艦船正徑直駛向聯邦領空
Those ships are headed straight for Federation territory.

548
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,900
警告星際艦隊
Warn Starfleet.

549
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,440
只能使用深空通訊中繼聯絡
It's a deep space relay.

550
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,140
我無法確實他們是否收到了訊息
I won't be able to confirm if they receive it.

551
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,280
我們得走了
We need to go.

552
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,760
離開該星系的干擾範圍
Get clear of this system's interference.

553
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,620
艦長 如果我們現在失去沃凱礦的信號
Captain, if we lose our lock on the wolkite signal,

554
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,640
我無法保證我們能再次進行追蹤
I'm not sure we can reestablish contact.

555
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,760
我們會失去外勤小隊和殖民地居民
We'll lose the landing party and the colonists.

556
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,460
我們可以放置一個遠程通信浮標
We can drop a long-range communication buoy.

557
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,980
將信號連接到浮標上
Tie a signal to it.

558
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,700
這樣我們回來時就能找到他們了
That way we can come back for them.

559
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,370
這是我能想到的最好辦法了
It's the best I've got.

560
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,180
就這麼做
Do it.

561
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,990
我們必須阻止這場入侵
We have to stop this invasion.

562
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,820
通信浮標已部署
Communication buoy is deployed.

563
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,600
米歇爾 持續鎖定敵方艦隊
Mitchell, stay on that enemy fleet.

564
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,700
調轉艦艏
Bringing her about.

565
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,560
盡快曲速離開這裡
As soon as we can, you warp out of here.

566
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,780
全速前進 直到我們能夠將警報發給星際艦隊
Full throttle until we can alert Starfleet.

567
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,360
現在我們是聯邦唯一的指望了
We're the only hope the Federation's got right now.

568
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:03,040
（* 此處查普爾和史波克穿的防護服與《原初系列》1x06 “The Naked Time” 中穿著的防護服是同一樣式）

569
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,260
計算機 啟動隔離模式
Computer, engage quarantine mode.

570
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,320
隔離模式已啟動
Quarantine mode engaged.

571
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,160
如果失敗的話 這就是法雷奧貝塔*的悲劇重演
If this goes sideways, it's, it's Valeo Beta all over again.

572
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,160
（* 見《奇異新世界》1x09 聯邦星艦遊隼號上爆發戈恩寄生疫情 墜毀在法雷奧貝塔五星）

573
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,640
戈恩卵疫情在全艦爆發的可能性將會是
The probability of a full-scale Gorn outbreak...

574
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,690
我真的不想知道
I really don't want to know.

575
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,650
查普爾護士 聯邦星艦進取號
Nurse Chapel, USS Enterprise...

576
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,350
向患者巴特爾注射
...injecting Patient Batel

577
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,090
實驗性血漿溶液
with experimental plasma solution.

578
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,320
有進展嗎 少尉
Anything, Ensign?

579
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,160
通訊仍受阻礙 艦長
Still jammed, sir.

580
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,660
戈恩人正在發送干擾信號
The Gorn are transmitting an interference signal.

581
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,070
距我們離開雙星系統進入曲速還有多久
How long before we clear these binary stars and go to warp?

582
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,200
時間不夠
Not soon enough.

583
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,590
戈恩星艦的航速比我們快得多
Those Gorn ships are moving a lot faster than we are.

584
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,600
等警告發出
By the time we get a signal out,

585
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,860
戈恩艦隊已經到達聯邦外圍成員國的位置了
the Gorn will be right on top of the outer Federation worlds.

586
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,940
他們只能坐以待斃
They're sitting ducks.

587
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,120
米歇爾 我們在戈恩艦隊的武器射程內嗎
Mitchell, are we in shooting distance of the Gorn?

588
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,320
克里斯
Chris,

589
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,040
你要讓進取號對陣整個戈恩艦隊嗎
Enterprise against an entire armada?

590
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,700
我們根本不是對手
We wouldn't stand a chance.

591
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,280
派克呼叫科學實驗室
Pike to science lab.

592
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,180
佩利亞 我需要你到艦橋來
Pelia, I need you on the bridge.

593
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,620
好的 艦長 馬上來
Aye, Captain, right away.

594
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,020
你打算做什麼
What are you up to?

595
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,670
你和烏乎拉
You and Uhura,

596
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,630
你們之前說恆星耀斑決定了
you said stellar flares can dictate

597
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,280
戈恩人的狩獵和休眠週期
a Gorn's hunting and resting cycles.

598
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,860
確實如此
Right.

599
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,770
我們甚至知道哪種輻射信號
We even know precisely what kind of radiation signature

600
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,500
可以讓戈恩人陷入休眠
would tell the Gorn to go to sleep.

601
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,560
艦長 這只是理論上的
Um, sir, that's just a theory.

602
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,070
所以
So...

603
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,390
我們只需要人為製造一場恆星耀斑爆發
...we just need to create a stellar flare.

604
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,020
抱歉打斷您 艦長
Oh, forgive me for interrupting,

605
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,870
但我們基本沒辦法對恆星造成什麼影響
but you cannot make a star do much of anything.

606
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,800
更別說是精確控制耀斑爆發了
Certainly not precisely, Captain.

607
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,580
所以我們需要自己成為一次日冕物質拋射
Which is why we need to become a CME, uh,

608
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,390
也就是X級耀斑
X-flare ourselves.

609
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,240
艦長 你看
Captain, look.

610
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,480
抱歉 你介意騰位置嗎
Uh, sorry, do you mind?

611
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,300
嗯是 用星艦來操作
Eh, sure, using the ship

612
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,500
的確能讓我們精準調控發射的輻射和電磁信號
would allow us to modulate the exact radiation and EM signals we'd emit.

613
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,410
但你說的基本上就是
But you're basically talking about

614
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,280
把整艘船變成一顆人造恆星
turning the ship into an artificial star.

615
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,710
這基本上是不可能的
That's-that's nearly impossible.

616
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,180
但並非完全不可能
But not impossible.

617
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,340
為了達到這個目的 我們必須深入到
To do that, we'd have to go deeper

618
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,180
這個致死的輻射區裡
into this deadly radiation zone,

619
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,940
徑直飛過外面那對雙星之間
fly right between those binary stars out there,

620
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,120
想辦法製造一個對抗磁場
and create some kind of competing magnetic field

621
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,470
將粒子從雙星中引開
to draw particles away from both of them.

622
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,820
需要調整偏導護盾 通訊陣列 還有
Modify the deflector shields, comms array, and, well...

623
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,860
基本上系統都得重改一遍
every-everything else, really.

624
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,650
連艦體都要磁化 才能吸引恆星物質
Magnetize the hull to attract stellar material.

625
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,650
成功的機率是千分之一
It's one in a thousand we'd get it done right

626
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,960
要麼能完成任務要麼炸飛自己 看吧
or don't blow ourselves up along the way, and, look.

627
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,050
我也不確定 但我願意賭一把
Yeah, I don't know. I like those odds.

628
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,140
我們就
We'll just...

629
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,100
在爆炸前把它關閉
...turn it off before we blow up.

630
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,190
就這麼辦
Get it done.

631
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,580
患者對輸血反應良好
Patient is responding favorably to the transfusion.

632
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,460
準備進行第一次手術切口
Ready to make the first incision.

633
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,660
等一下
Wait.

634
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,070
你知道最壞的情況是巴特爾艦長會殉職
You know the most likely outcome is the death of Captain Batel?

635
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,760
我們只是需要一點信心
We just have to have a little faith.

636
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,550
或許我們是從錯誤的角度來看待這件事的
Perhaps we are looking at this from the wrong perspective.

637
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,120
與其在治療巴特爾上花時間
Instead of operating on Batel,

638
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,250
要是我們試著去對付一下戈恩人呢
what if we treated the Gorn inside of her?

639
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,400
它們想要孵化出來覓食
We know they emerge to feed.

640
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,620
要是我們給它們餵食呢
What if we feed them?

641
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,350
把它們餵飽 防止它們孵化
Satiate them to keep them from coming out.

642
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,580
當他們不再處於攻擊狀態時 把它們幹掉
And when they are no longer in defensive mode, dissolve them.

643
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,570
並用烏娜的伊勒利亞血漿
And use Una's Illyrian plasma

644
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,440
來對抗他們在重新吸收過程中
to fight the multitude of infections that will result

645
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,720
產生的大量感染
from their reabsorption.

646
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,420
沒錯
Yes.

647
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,840
但我們沒有時間再去模擬一次了
But we don't have enough time to run another simulation.

648
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,560
就像你剛才提議的那樣
As you suggested,

649
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,940
也許我們只是需要一點信心
perhaps we just need a little faith.

650
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,470
我們甩掉他們了嗎
Did we lose them?

651
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,140
或許吧
Maybe,

652
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,120
即便甩掉了 也是暫時的
but if so, then not for long.

653
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,660
這是個接口
This is an interface.

654
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,920
在戈恩的繁殖星球上
They had them on the Gorn...

655
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,360
也有這樣的裝置
the Gorn breeding planet.

656
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,740
我哥哥馬努 他
My brother Manu, he...

657
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,840
別害怕
Don't be afraid.

658
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,980
無論如何 別停下來
Keep moving, no matter what.

659
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,740
嘿
Hey.

660
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,800
嘿
Hey.

661
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,590
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

662
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,940
你現在在這裡 而不是在過去的那個地方
You're here now, not back there.

663
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,380
是啊 但這裡也沒好到哪去 不是嗎
Yeah, but here's not great either, is it?

664
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,380
是啊 確實很糟糕
No, I suppose not.

665
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,460
我有印象了 讓我試試看
I remember. Let me try something.

666
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,800
太神奇了
This is amazing.

667
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,440
我很想把這個拆開 弄明白它是怎麼運作的
I'd love to take this apart, figure out how it works.

668
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,480
真是好主意
Yeah, good idea.

669
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,640
在這待上一天慢慢研究吧
Let's make a whole day of it.

670
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,340
吃點零食 在這閒逛
Get snacks, hang out.

671
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,640
那些看起來像是緩衝信號
Those look like buffer signatures.

672
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,040
是的 還有傳送授權碼
They are. And the transport codes.

673
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,170
如果我們能把這個送回進取號
If we can get this to the Enterprise,

674
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,860
就能救走殖民地的居民
then we can save the colonists.

675
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,700
拯救所有人
All of them.

676
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,270
大伙們
Guys...

677
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,910
快去船上
Get to the ship!

678
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,580
我們就位了
We are in position,

679
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,200
正在接近雙星
approaching the binary stars.

680
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,240
當我們關閉電磁脈衝發生器的瞬間
The moment we shut down the EM emitter,

681
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,220
每一艘戈恩星艦都會直奔我們而來
every single Gorn ship is going to come at us.

682
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,690
就像飛蛾撲火一樣
Like moths to a flame.

683
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,090
這也正是我們想要的效果
Which is exactly what we want.

684
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,960
大家準備好了嗎
Everybody ready?

685
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,100
像太陽一般閃耀吧
Make us shine like the sun.

686
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,570
駕駛位
The pilot seat.

687
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,130
讓我坐駕駛位
Put me in the pilot seat.

688
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,220
我來駕駛它
Put me in the pilot seat!

689
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,570
別逞強了
Forget about it!

690
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,750
我能讓它飛起來 這非我不可
I can fly it. It has to be me.

691
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,050
她說得對 我們必須得離開這
She's right. We need to go.

692
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,520
我們完全暴露在β粒子和伽馬射線中了
We're covered in beta particles and gamma rays.

693
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,880
星艦正在承受著臨界水平的輻射
This ship is hitting critical levels of radiation!

694
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,020
戈恩人在做什麼
What are the Gorn doing?

695
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,960
他們已經脫離編隊
They have broken ranks,

696
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,050
目前正處於進取號的攔截航線上
currently on intercept course with Enterprise.

697
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,480
目前看起來一切順利
All right, so far, so good.

698
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,350
現在看看它們會不會向我們開火
Now let's see if they shoot at us.

699
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,100
艦長 我收到了一個
Captain, I have a signal bouncing off

700
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,490
通訊信標反射的信號
the communications beacon.

701
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,490
是拉安 長官
It's La'An, sir.

702
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,420
進取號 能收到嗎
Enterprise, are you there?

703
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,320
拉安 你在哪
La'An, where are you?

704
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,590
在路上 如果能收到信號的話
On our way. If you can read me,

705
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,200
注意接收我向你們發送的傳送密碼
I'm sending you transport codes.

706
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,760
把帕納索斯人傳送出去
Beam the Parnassians out.

707
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,740
我們正在嘗試傳送
We're trying to beam you out,

708
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,940
但我們難以鎖定你們
but we're having trouble getting a lock.

709
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,060
你們收到了嗎
Do you copy?

710
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,720
它們正衝着我們來
They're gaining on us!

711
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,080
進取號 你們是否收到
Enterprise, do you read me?

712
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,210
把帕納索斯人傳送回艦
Beam the Parnassians out.

713
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,150
艦長 艦體完整性即將逼近極限
Captain, hull integrity is approaching critical failure!

714
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,160
把它關掉 關掉它
Turn it off. Turn it off!

715
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,980
起作用了嗎
Did it work?

716
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,390
沒錯 艦長 最後一艘戈恩船只已返回母星
Aye, sir, the last of the Gorn have gone home.

717
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,540
帕納索斯人呢
What about the Parnassians?

718
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,740
我們及時把他們傳回來了嗎
Did we get them out in time?

719
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,380
是的 艦長
Yes, Captain.

720
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,180
拉安的傳送密碼生效了
The transport codes from La'An worked.

721
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,320
幾百名殖民地居民已經被救回
Several hundred colonists accounted for

722
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,190
正在送往應急醫務室
and headed for the overflow infirmary.

723
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,180
艦長 我們急需--
Captain, we need immediate as--

724
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,580
將我們傳送上艦並讓一個醫療小組待命
Beam us out and have a medical team standing by.

725
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,140
派克呼叫輪機部
Pike to Engineering?

726
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,110
是 艦長 我們正在使用傳送碼
Aye, Captain, we're using the transport codes

727
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,860
破解戈恩狩獵艦的系統
to hack into the Gorn hunter,

728
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,180
應該很快就能搞定
should be just a moment.

729
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,940
克里斯 我們做到了
Chris. Chris, we did it.

730
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,600
我們引起了戈恩人的長時休眠
We triggered a long hibernation in the Gorn.

731
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,990
是啊
Yeah...

732
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,880
但我忍不住在想
But I can't help wondering

733
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,430
我們會不會只是把麻煩推給了未來的人們
if we didn't just create a problem for someone else to solve later.

734
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,650
艦長 我收到了艾普里爾上將的加密呼叫
Captain. I'm getting a secure channel from Admiral April.

735
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,830
接通
Put him through.

736
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,350
克里斯 我們剛收到你的優先級訊息
Chris. We just got your priority message.

737
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,380
在戈恩艦隊到這之前我們還有多少時間
How much time do we have before the Gorn ships get here?

738
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,830
請忽略最後一條訊息
Ignore last transmission.

739
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,820
至少在一段時間內我們見不著戈恩人
We won't be seeing the Gorn, at least not for a while.

740
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,140
你有幾分把握
How certain are you?

741
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,720
怎麼說呢 我已經對戈恩人還以顏色了
Let's just say I found a way to punch back.

742
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,250
保持清醒 別暈過去
Stay with me. Stay with me.

743
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,560
我做的很棒
I did good.

744
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,730
不是嗎
Didn't I?

745
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,650
別說話了 你能撐住的
Stop. You're going to make it.

746
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,350
想幹掉我 他們還不夠格
They'll have to try harder than that.

747
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,270
我可是艾麗卡·奧特加斯
I'm Erica Ortegas.

748
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,960
無敵舵手
