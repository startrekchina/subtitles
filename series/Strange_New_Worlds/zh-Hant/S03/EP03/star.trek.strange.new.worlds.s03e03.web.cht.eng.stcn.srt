1
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:23,806
《星際迷航: 新世界》前情提要
Previously on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds...

2
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:24,937
艾麗卡傷勢嚴重 但傷情穩定了
Erica is critical, but stable.

3
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,440
我到現在都覺得像是在做夢
Still doesn't feel totally real.

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,240
我本該死了的
I should be dead.

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,360
我還活著只是僥天之幸
I'm on borrowed time.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,760
我還沒準備好和你分別
I'm not ready to let you go.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,840
達克'拉赫將軍
General Dak'Rah.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,280
我知道你和查普爾都曾駐紮在加戈爾上
I know you and Chapel were both stationed on J'Gal, 

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,561
拉赫就是在那裡成名的
where Rah earned his reputation.

10
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:44,800
姆'本加 我來這裡是為了給你提供療癒
M'Benga, I'm here to provide healing.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,920
把你的手從我身上拿開
Get your hands off me! Don't!

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,340
不是我先動手的
I didn't start the fight.

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,860
但我很高興他死了
But I'm glad he's dead.

14
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:01,600
艦長個人日誌
Captain's personal log,

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,020
星曆2449.1
stardate 2449.1.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,631
進取號要去完成一個常規掃描任務
Enterprise has embarked on a routine scanning mission,

17
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,242
這給了我和瑪麗一些額外的相處時間
giving Marie and me some time

18
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:09,895
她很快就要去
to enjoy our last few days together

19
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:11,320
新的船上任職了
before her new commission.

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,460
我才剛習慣她的裝飾風格
I was just getting used to her decorating choices,

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,860
但一位艦長終歸是屬於她自己的船的
but a captain belongs on her own ship.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,711
我們原本以為
We had every reason to believe

23
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,240
那些難以捉摸的戈恩組織已完全萎縮
the evasive Gorn tissue was in full remission.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,680
但不幸的是 它們復發了
But, unfortunately, it's returned.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,380
而且呈現出高度侵襲性
And it's aggressive.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,540
但是情況也不是完全無望
And yet, hope is not lost.

27
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,664
奇美拉之花
The Chimera Blossom.

28
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:40,500
一個珍稀品種
A rare specimen, 

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,340
因其獨特的生物特性而備受追捧
long sought-after for its biological uniqueness.

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,760
這種花 可以治好她嗎
This flower-- it can help her?

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,193
希望渺茫 克里斯
It's a long shot, Chris.

32
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,140
但據傳
But it is rumored

33
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,140
其中含有一種特殊化合物
to contain a chemical compound

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,940
這種化合物普遍擁有
that is universal in its ability

35
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,960
協助入侵分子穿透細胞膜的能力
to move invasive molecules through cell membranes.

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,720
也許能遏制惡性腫瘤
Could stop the malignancy.

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,580
爭取治療的時間
Buying us time.

38
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,120
為什麼我嗅到了弦外之音
Why am I sensing a caveat?

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,780
正如史波克所說 它很稀有
Well, like Spock said, it's rare.

40
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,420
我們已經找到了一處
And we've tracked down the one place

41
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,215
有可能長有奇美拉之花的地方
the Chimera is likely to be found.

42
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:10,040
在一個叫肯佛瑞的星球
It's a planet called Kenfori.

43
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,180
肯佛瑞?
Kenfori?

44
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,080
那整個星系都禁止通航
That whole system is a no-fly zone.

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,351
是啊 確實
Yeah, that's true.

46
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,340
但是那裡原先有一個
But it was once the location

47
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,963
星聯的科研設施
of a Federation research facility,

48
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:19,878
主要致力於新興地區農業研究
focused mainly on frontier farming,

49
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:21,315
特別是作物長效培育技術
specifically crop longevity.

50
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:23,839
後來在戰爭初期 那裡被克林貢占領了
The Klingons invaded at the start of the war

51
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,600
我們的所有權有了爭議
and our claim fell into dispute.

52
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,260
戰爭結束之後 雙方都同意放棄爭奪此地
After the war ended, both sides agreed to give it up.

53
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,060
所以這不僅是個禁航區域
So it's not just a no-fly zone.

54
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,520
還是個限制區域
It's the restricted zone.

55
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,420
我們去那裡的話
We can't go anywhere near it

56
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,895
會違反一堆外交條約
without violating multiple treaties.

57
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:38,480
我告訴過他們這個主意簡直瘋了 克里斯
Told them it was crazy, Chris.

58
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,900
我不會讓大家為了我一個人冒這麼大的風險
I won't allow people to take risks like this for me.

59
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,200
我更不會眼睜睜地看著你死 
I won't watch you die. 

60
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,080
如果這種花能救治你 我們就要拿到它
If this blossom will help you, we are going to get it.

61
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,660
但是
But

62
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,516
星際艦隊肯定不會批准這種事
Starfleet will never authorize this.

63
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,380
我們得偷偷地幹這件事
This has to be completely off the books.

64
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,880
所以我們提議派一個小型外勤隊去
That is why we propose a minimal away team.

65
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,739
就姆'本加醫生和我去就行
Just Dr. M'Benga and myself.

66
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,220
計劃挺好
Good plan.

67
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,438
只需做一處調整
With one adjustment.

68
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
看吧 要來了
Here it comes.

69
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,900
如果必須得有人為此違規 那也得是我
If anyone's going to break the rules, it's going to be me.

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,180
早就說他會這樣了吧
Told them that, too.

71
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,240
我很感激你自願參與任務 史波克先生
I appreciate you stepping up Mr. Spock,

72
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,640
但是如果我們被發現了 責任在我
but if we're caught, the responsibility falls on me.

73
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,886
別小看我啊 艦長
You insult me, Captain.

74
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,020
他從來沒被發現過
He never gets caught.

75
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,360
我從來沒被發現過
I never get caught.

76
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:17,197
斯坎內爾中尉
Lieutenant Scannell,

77
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,459
請把肯佛瑞星系周圍
please pull up cartography

78
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,980
緩衝帶的星圖調取出來
on the buffer zone around the Kenfori system.

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,260
看起來條約劃定的分界線
Looks like the treaty line is

80
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,900
正處於一片巨型星塵帶的邊緣
on the edge of a giant dust belt.

81
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,815
我已經很久沒有飛進過
Been a long time since I've flown

82
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,686
有爭議的克林貢星域了
into disputed Klingon territory.

83
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,775
是路過有爭議的克林貢星域
Around disputed Klingon territory.

84
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,640
進取號不會跨越分界線
Enterprise will not cross that line.

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,300
一旦穿梭機飛進星塵帶
Once the shuttle clears that dust belt,

86
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,389
個人通訊將徹底中斷
personal comms will be down.

87
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,280
我們可以通過凍結所有通訊信號
We can maintain their cover by freezing all other 

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,440
來給他們打掩護
communications as well.

89
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,655
我會設置一個加密的艦對艦頻道
I'm setting up an encrypted ship-to-ship channel

90
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,780
這樣艦長就能和我們保持聯絡
for the captain to check in on the hour.

91
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,640
不需要我提醒你們 
I do not need to remind you 

92
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,420
一旦穿梭機被發現 會有什麼後果吧
of the consequences if our away team's shuttle is discovered.

93
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,920
奧特加斯 我們出發吧
Ortegas, take us out.

94
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:09,118
有趣的部分來了
Now comes the fun part.

95
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,741
顯擺
Show-off.

96
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,529
歡迎大家盡情誇獎 鼓掌喝彩
I'll accept any and all accolades and applause

97
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,618
小費我也收哦
and tips.

98
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:33,640
承認吧 你們都懷念我精湛的駕駛技術
Admit it. You all missed my fancy flying.

99
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,460
我們確實懷念
We did, actually.

100
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,580
就像騎自行車一樣
Like riding a bike.

101
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,819
只不過這自行車用的核聚變引擎
With fusion-powered thrusters.

102
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:00,430
我以為你可恨我的飛行技術了
And all this time I thought you hated my flying.

103
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:04,000
你還記得在波瑞利斯ζ星那次嗎
You remember Zeta Borealis?

104
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,045
穿梭機落地的一瞬間
The moment our shuttle landed,

105
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:08,580
你一腳踢開防爆門
you kicked open those storm doors

106
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,115
當場嘔吐了起來
and you threw up.

107
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:15,837
如果我沒記錯的話 那是因為我們之前
If memory serves, it was those Vedalan cigars

108
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,600
抽了維達蘭雪茄的緣故
we smoked the night before.

109
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,000
不過說實話 那些維達蘭人辦的派對真是一絕
Well, those Vedalans knew how to throw a party, let's be honest.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,940
絕對的
Oh, definitely

111
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,714
即使事後頭疼都值了
worth the headache.

112
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,000
在我們行進的路線上有一個物體
Oh, there's an object in our path.

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,600
成分無法確定
Indeterminate composition.

114
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,120
星塵帶有干擾 沒法掃描
Can't get a reading in this dust belt.

115
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,820
戰爭期間 這種地方布滿了雙方布下的
During the war this area would have been teeming with mines.

116
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,769
太空雷陣
Federation and Klingon.

117
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,880
但是根據條約 空雷應該被排除了才對
Per the treaty, they should have all been swept.

118
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,035
也許他們遺漏了一個
Maybe they missed one.

119
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,340
我會與之保持距離 最好把護盾也升起來
I'll keep a distance. Better raise shields.

120
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,120
打開通訊系統
Turn on comms.

121
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,393
正在將通訊系統設置為克林貢常用頻段
Setting comms to common Klingon frequency range.

122
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,269
這是一個通訊信標
It's a communications beacon.

123
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,185
這裡有一條信息
Something's coming through.

124
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,960
你見過這個嗎
You ever see that before?

125
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,105
是啊 在戰爭期間見過
Yes, in the war.

126
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:09,380
我曾被派駐到一座被炸毀的克林貢礦場附近
I was once stationed near a bombed Klingon mine

127
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,327
那裡有嚴重的輻射危險
with radiation danger.

128
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:14,025
大致翻譯一下就是「要麼滾回去 要麼等死」
Loosely translated it means, "Go back or die."

129
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,840
但他們為什麼要在這裡放警示信標
But why leave a warning beacon here?

130
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,814
不管了
It doesn't matter.

131
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:22,425
我們沒有退路
Going back is not an option.

132
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,290
沒有生命跡象
No life signs.

133
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,000
所以這裡除了我們 沒別人
So we are all alone down here.

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,060
不 艦長
No, Captain,

135
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,580
我是說完全沒有生命體徵
I mean no life signs.

136
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:37,280
全是植物 沒有動物
All flora, no fauna...

137
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,083
如此富饒的生物群落中沒有動物嗎
In a biome this rich?

138
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,800
這裡肯定有地方存在著動物
There must be animal life here somewhere.

139
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,566
算了 至少我們是來找植物的
Well, at least the flora's all that matters.

140
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,089
你看到下山路上的那個湖了嗎
You see that lake on the way down?

141
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,580
看到了 非常適合飛釣
Ah, perfect for fly-fishing.

142
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,100
是啊 要是我們沒有在執行任務
Yeah, if we weren't always on a mission.

143
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,314
而且還得有動物能上鈎才行
And if there was something alive to catch.

144
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,664
有道理
Fair point.

145
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,232
那應該就是我們的研究站了
That must be our research facility.

146
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:58,700
根據克莉絲汀的研究
Christine's research suggests 

147
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,280
他們應該會把那種花的樣本保存在內
they would have kept samples of the flower inside.

148
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,600
至少我們不用把整片森林翻個遍了
At least we don't have to scour this whole forest.

149
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,200
所以 你怎麼看科爾比和克里斯汀這對情侶
So, what do you think of this whole Korby-Christine thing?

150
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,900
哦 克里斯 
Ah, Chris, 

151
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,120
要我提醒你 我離過三次婚嗎
do I have to remind you I have three ex-wives?

152
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,600
準確來說是四個
Well, four, technically.

153
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,077
那一次不算
That was an annulment.

154
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:17,060
不過下一位嘛
But the next one...

155
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,471
醫者可以自醫嗎
Physician heal thyself?

156
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:22,170
我更願意說 我還在不斷進步中
I like to consider myself a work in progress.

157
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,800
有生命跡象了嗎
Life sign?

158
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,985
恰恰相反
The opposite.

159
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,100
陣亡的士兵嗎
War casualty?

160
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
不是
No.

161
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,080
戰鬥中不可能會有這種創傷
You don't see these wounds in battle.

162
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,583
他的胸腔被整個剖開了
His rib cage has been split open.

163
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,080
挨了不止一發相位槍
Not a single phaser burn.

164
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,160
從腐爛程度來看
Given the rate of decay,

165
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,675
我判斷他是在撤離之後死去的
I'd say he died after the evacuation.

166
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:51,340
像是被什麼動物殺死的
Killed by some kind of animal maybe?

167
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,260
只是
Only...

168
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,120
這裡沒有動物
Only no life signs.

169
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,440
會是早已離開的動物嗎
An animal that's long gone?

170
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,700
最好不要冒這個險
Better not risk it.

171
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,775
相位槍準備
Phasers.

172
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:24,680
備用能源還在運作著
Auxiliary power's still on.

173
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,889
十分微弱
Barely.

174
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:30,760
這裡發生的事情真是令人遺憾
It's a shame what happened here.

175
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,820
戰爭奪走了一切
The war took everything.

176
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,962
這個是奇美拉之花嗎
Chimera Blossoms?

177
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:05,969
親眼所見 果然更驚艷
Even more beautiful in person.

178
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,700
得來全不費功夫啊
Didn't have to look far, huh?

179
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,160
別靠近
Wait.

180
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,548
你的背包裡有一個面罩
There's a set of these in your bag.

181
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,332
尋找那些盛開的花朵
Look for the ones in full bloom.

182
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:23,640
但不要用皮膚直接接觸它們
But don't touch them with bare skin.

183
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,220
這些到底是什麼
What exactly are these?

184
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,660
只是預防措施而已
It's just a precaution.

185
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:32,320
劑量不當的話 藥物也可能具有毒性
At improper doses, the medication can be toxic.

186
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,380
某些有機毒物具有藥用價值
Certain organic poisons have medicinal value.

187
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,480
幾個世紀以來 醫生們用這些
Doctors have used them for centuries

188
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,900
來治療心臟疾病
to treat heart disease,

189
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,620
瘧疾
malaria...

190
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,402
這能讓她維持多久
How long will this give her?

191
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,755
你知道 任何船員的病情和治療情況
You know the condition and treatment of any crew member

192
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,480
都是保密的
is confidential 

193
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,720
除非他們會對其他船員構成威脅
unless they jeopardize the rest of the crew.

194
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,100
我不是在以艦長的身份問你
Not as your captain.

195
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,284
而是以一個朋友的身份
As your friend.

196
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:02,180
以瑪麗的
As Marie's...

197
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,300
我需要知道
I need to know.

198
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,987
她有希望完全康復嗎
I-Is there a chance that she can really be saved?

199
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,642
這是她唯一康復的機會了
This is her only chance.

200
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:13,428
就在昨天 我們束手無策的時候
Just yesterday, we were out of options,

201
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:14,995
史波克又找到了一個治療方案
but Spock found one more.

202
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:16,039
一份希望
One to hope for.

203
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,560
克里斯 奮力一搏的機會
A fighting chance, Chris.

204
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,180
檢測到一股輕微的電磁波動	
Picking up a minor EM flux

205
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,907
正朝著肯佛瑞方向移動
moving towards Kenfori.

206
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:01,820
坐標 第八扇區 方位角15-29-4
Coordinates: Section Eight, mark 15-29-4.

207
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,060
傳感器顯示其在以一個不規則的運動軌跡移動
Sensors show it is moving in an irregular pattern.

208
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,133
這表明這是一種自然發生的現象
That suggests it's a naturally occurring phenomenon.

209
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,612
對於塵埃帶來說很正常
Normal for a dust belt.

210
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,120
收到 繼續觀察第九扇區
Copy. Continue to Section Nine.

211
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,360
長官 我提議對第八扇區進行二次掃描
Commander, I would like to recommend a secondary scan

212
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,011
這一回濾除電磁信號
of Section Eight, one that filters out EM rays.

213
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,860
我有預感
I've got a hunch.

214
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,884
安全點總沒錯
Better safe than sorry.

215
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,276
斯坎內爾中尉
Lieutenant Scannell?

216
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:20,460
重新掃描第八扇區
Rescanning Section Eight.

217
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,940
確認在電磁波動後方存在中微子輻射
Confirming neutrino emissions behind the flux.

218
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,920
正在檢測曲速信號
Checking for a warp signature.

219
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:29,720
是一艘克林貢戰列巡洋艦
It's a Klingon battle cruiser.

220
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,180
戰爭期間 他們經常使用電磁干擾
In the war they used to mask their ships

221
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,360
來掩蓋他們的曲速信號
behind bursts of EM radiation.

222
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,860
幹得漂亮 上尉
Good call, Lieutenant.

223
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,340
這改變不了什麼
This doesn't change a thing.

224
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,341
我們繼續保持在此監視他們
We continue monitoring from here

225
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:41,440
直到我們有理由接近
until we have reason not to.

226
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,340
中校 他們選擇現在露面
Commander, it's a pretty big coincidence

227
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,720
是個巨大的巧合
that they choose now to show up.

228
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,220
要是他們發現了艦長的穿梭機怎麼辦
What if they spotted the captain's shuttle?

229
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,140
或許吧
Maybe.

230
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,640
但克林貢人算不上有多遵守條約
But Klingons aren't famous for abiding by treaty.

231
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,222
他們可能只是來打撈殘骸的
These could just be scavengers.

232
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:54,500
我不喜歡在沒有證據的情況下妄下結論
I hate to assume causation where there isn't any.

233
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,000
烏乎拉 通訊上監聽到什麼東西嗎
Uhura, any comms chatter?

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,460
沒有 長官 所有通訊頻段都處於靜默狀態
Negative, sir, across all channels.

235
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,143
外面安靜得像圖書館一樣
It's quiet as a library out there.

236
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:01,520
有變化的話向我報告
Let me know if that changes.

237
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:05,460
現在 我們要沉住氣
For now... we'll sit tight.

238
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,000
這些傷口與外面那些
These wounds are consistent with

239
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,020
克林貢人遺骸上的傷口相符
those Klingon remains outside.

240
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,604
有什麼東西在同時殺害人類和克林貢人嗎
Something was killing both humans and Klingons?

241
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:28,650
如果可以稱之為殺害的話
If you can call it that.

242
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,500
這更像是生吞活剝
More like devouring.

243
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,460
走吧 我們已經拿到需要的東西了
Come on. We got what we came for.

244
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,395
撤退吧
Let's go.

245
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,052
那肯定是個活物
That had to be alive.

246
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,200
是發生故障的實驗室設備
Malfunctioning lab equipment.

247
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,040
我還是沒有檢測到任何生命信號
I'm still not getting any life signs.

248
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,260
不會吧
Humor me.

249
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:58,636
什麼都沒有
Nothing.

250
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,660
我們的穿梭機
Our shuttle.

251
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,995
有可能他們不知道我們的存在
It's possible they don't know about us.

252
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,160
現在他們知道了
They know about us.

253
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,280
<i>人類的惡臭在空氣中瀰漫不散</i>

254
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,540
<i>他們離得不遠了</i>

255
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,120
<i>省著點用</i>

256
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,260
<i>留著能量對付他們</i>

257
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,500
<i>三錄儀給我</i>

258
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,800
<i>他們說上去的人沒一個能活著回來</i>

259
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,140
<i>準備好為榮譽赴死了嗎</i>

260
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:22,894
這是場狩獵派對
It's a hunting party.

261
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:24,679
他們像獵斯克拉兔子一樣在追我們
They're chasing us like Skral rabbits.

262
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,115
如果我們被抓住了
If we're captured,

263
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:28,161
他們肯定也很樂意把我們做成標本
they'll want to make examples of us.

264
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,240
我猜兩條路都一樣
I'm sure the other direction was equally as bad.

265
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,960
你知道他們看到了就會開槍
You know they'll shoot on sight.

266
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,860
那我們就先開槍
Then we shoot first.

267
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,680
擊暈擋
On stun.

268
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,220
快跑
Run.

269
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,980
<i>撤退</i>

270
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,160
你給我打的是安慰劑嗎
Are you hitting me with placebo right now?

271
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,160
你的身體已經適應了止痛藥
Your body has acclimated to the pain inhibitors.

272
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,560
查普爾護士應該可以
Nurse Chapel should...

273
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,130
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

274
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,880
巴特爾艦長
Captain Batel.

275
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,831
我理解您的不適在加劇
I understand your discomfort has increased.

276
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:57,540
史波克
Spock.

277
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,520
還用你說
You think?

278
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,260
瓦肯人有一種古代技藝
Vulcans have an ancient technique

279
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,660
能通過冥想來調節疼痛
of regulating pain through meditation.

280
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,446
經過練習 人類也可以掌握
With practice, humans can do it, too.

281
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:04,926
儘管如此 要達到我認為您需要的水平
However, achieving a level I suspect you need

282
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:06,275
需要的時間是我們等不起的
will take time we do not have.

283
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:08,364
查普爾護士建議我來引導您
Nurse Chapel has suggested I guide you through it

284
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:10,360
借助心靈融合的形式 如果您願意的話
using a form of mind meld, if you consent.

285
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,585
什麼都行
Pretty much anything.

286
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,520
吾思即汝思
My mind to your mind.

287
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,540
同呼吸共命運
One breath between us.

288
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,867
無論你在做什麼 請繼續
Whatever you're doing, keep doing.

289
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,304
是您的自尊心承受著痛苦
Your ego holds the pain.

290
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:37,900
讓您的思想放下自尊心
Let your mind release your ego,

291
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,040
這樣或許可以減輕您的痛苦
so it may eclipse your suffering.

292
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,853
史波克
Spock!

293
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:03,898
快醒醒
Snap out of it!

294
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,295
史波克 放開她 是我啊
Let go of her, Spock. It's me.

295
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:10,296
克里斯汀
It's Christine.

296
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,349
我似乎暫時情緒失控了
I seem to have temporarily lost control.

297
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,860
那還用說
You sure did.

298
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,560
瑪麗 你還好嗎
Marie, are-are you okay?

299
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,160
還好
Yeah.

300
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,320
發生什麼了
What happened?

301
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,192
當我們心靈融合的時候 我吸納了您的痛苦
When we joined minds, I absorbed your pain.

302
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,380
但我也
But I also...

303
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,456
我看到了什麼
I saw something.

304
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:41,700
是的 我也是
Yes, as did I.

305
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,620
它感覺既像是您的一部分 又不是
It felt both a part of you and not.

306
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,920
是戈恩嗎
Was it Gorn?

307
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,248
這可能嗎
Is that even possible?

308
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,780
恐怕我兩個問題都無法回答 艦長
I am afraid I do not have the answer to either question, Captain.

309
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,735
謝謝你 史波克先生
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

310
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:00,600
我現在好多了
The pain is much better now.

311
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,565
史波克少校
Lieutenant Spock,

312
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:05,060
金萊利中校命令全體高級軍官到待命室報到
Commander Chin-Riley needs all senior officers in the ready room.

313
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,060
我很快就來
I will be there momentarily.

314
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,572
不好意思 少尉
My apologies, Ensign.

315
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,797
我們可能有麻煩了
We may have a situation.

316
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:19,740
外勤隊沒有在預定的時間和我們通訊
Our away team failed to check in at the prescheduled time.

317
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,600
他們兩人的應答器都開著
Their transponders are both active,

318
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,280
但不回應我們從進取號發出的任何呼叫
but they are not responding to any hails from the Enterprise, 

319
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,458
 換句話說
which means

320
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,600
要麼是他們的通訊器出了問題
they're either having comms trouble or...

321
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,680
要麼人出了什麼事
something else happened.

322
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,060
中尉
Lieutenant.

323
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,640
佩利亞中校有時間親自前來參會嗎
Does Commander Pelia plan to grace us with her presence?

324
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,000
呃 她沒空
She, uh,

325
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
所以派我來了
got delayed and sent me.

326
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:40,647
好藉口 我知道她不喜歡開會
Nice try. I know she hates these meetings.

327
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:41,909
請坐
Sit.

328
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,920
我們需要在不引起克林貢人注意的前提下
We need to get within emergency beaming range

329
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,840
進入緊急傳送機的工作範圍
without attracting any Klingon attention.

330
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,880
我推薦緩慢接近
I recommend a slow approach.

331
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:53,020
以低脈衝推力航行能將我們
Flying at low impulse will keep us

332
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,780
隱藏在碎片帶運動的背景噪聲下
below the noise limit of debris motion.

333
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:56,880
他們的傳感器將無法
Their sensors will not be able

334
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,320
區分我們和星塵顆粒
to tell us apart from the dust particles.

335
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,940
那就是說我們只能以低脈衝推力航行
Well, we'd have to move at a fraction of impulse

336
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,020
而且還要關掉所有非必要系統
and shut down all nonessential systems.

337
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,720
但如果能讓我們隱形 那倒也值得
But if we were invisible, might be worth it.

338
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,580
根據我的估算 我們將需要四個小時到達肯佛瑞星
By my calculations, we would reach Kenfori in four hours.

339
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:11,634
這我能接受
I can live with that.

340
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:12,700
奧特加斯
Ortegas.

341
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,942
和史波克一起規劃一條航線
Plot a course with Mr. Spock.

342
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:16,987
四個小時
Four hours?

343
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:18,424
不 我不同意
Yeah, that won't work for me.

344
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:22,220
請說明 上尉
Explain yourself, Lieutenant.

345
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,691
我們幹嘛還要踮著腳躲著克林貢人
Why are we tiptoeing around these Klingons?

346
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,160
既然他們顯然已經知道姆'本加醫生和艦長在那了
It's obvious they know about the captain and Dr. M'Benga.

347
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,600
我們的當務之急應該是盡快把他們救出來
Our priority should be getting them out fast.

348
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,820
那你怎麼確保我們能夠在
And how do you propose we do that

349
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,020
不違反邊界條約的情況下做到這點
without violating a border treaty?

350
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,400
而且 假設
Hypothetically,

351
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,094
即便有可能接近
even if there were a way,

352
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:38,269
星塵帶的干擾
the interference from the dust belt

353
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:40,140
也會讓傳送機無法使用
makes transporting impossible.

354
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,120
我已經想到了個辦法可以同時解決這兩個問題
I've thought about both problems.

355
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,440
我們直接曲速進行星大氣熱層裡
We warp into the planet's thermosphere,

356
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,453
傳送完人 立馬曲速走 簡單
energize, and warp out, simple.

357
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,940
直接曲速進行星低軌道嗎
Warping into a low planetary orbit.

358
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,360
那很魯莽了
It's reckless.

359
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,580
你以前這麼幹過嗎
Have you ever done that?

360
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,040
還沒有
No.

361
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:57,220
但我能做到
But I could.

362
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,727
如此危險的機動極少有人嘗試
Such a dangerous maneuver is rarely attempted.

363
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,560
我估計高層大氣沒有問題
I could see the upper atmosphere maybe.

364
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,160
但我們只要沾到一點熱層的底
But if we scrape the bottom of the thermosphere,

365
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,840
船體就要被阻力扯成捲心菜瓣了
our hull would be shredded cabbage.

366
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,380
我不會讓這種事發生的
I won't let that happen.

367
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,920
此外 殘餘曲速場同樣會干擾傳送
Also, the residual warp field prohibits transport.

368
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,739
但在理論上 穿過局部曲速場
Well, in theory, one could lock in on a signal

369
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,020
建立傳送信號鎖定是可能的
through the residual field.

370
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:16,320
我沒有拆史波克先生的台的意思
Well, I don't mean to step on Mr. Spock's toes,

371
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,140
絕對沒有
of course, uh,

372
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,181
但只需要根據曲速場的空間扭曲程度
but you just have to calibrate the phase inducers

373
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:21,487
校準相位感應器
to the warp distortion.

374
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,445
當然 得非常快
Only, like, really fast.

375
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:24,440
就這樣
Yeah.

376
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,189
所以我的計劃全打鈎了
So my plan checks off all the boxes.

377
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:29,740
烏乎拉 有任何跡象表明
Uhura, is there any evidence

378
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,180
克林貢人知道外勤隊在地表嗎
the Klingons know about our people?

379
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,940
現在是完全的通訊靜默 一點聲音都沒有
Total comms silence out there, not even a whisper.

380
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:39,100
那麼史波克的計劃是最合理的
Then Spock's plan makes the most sense.

381
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,880
命令已經下達了
You have your orders.

382
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:48,775
真謝謝你啊 妮歐塔
Thanks a lot, Nyota.

383
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:53,910
我們是不是該談談奧特加斯上尉的事
Are we gonna discuss Lieutenant Ortegas?

384
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,820
她一直想做自己擅長的事
She was just doing her job.

385
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,560
我需要後備方案
I needed alternatives.

386
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,100
你說了算 但我想說
Your call, but, I mean,

387
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,300
她以前不像這樣
that wasn't like her.

388
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:03,660
她有時候可能很粗魯
She can be rude at times

389
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,380
但絕不會不服從
but not insubordinate.

390
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,940
會不會是太早讓她回歸崗位了
Could it be she's back on rotation too soon?

391
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:12,080
她已經過了心理關
She passed her psych eval.

392
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,260
畢竟就她的閱歷而言
And after all she went through,

393
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,520
她那有點毛躁的作風倒也在我的意料之中
I'm not surprised if she's a little rough around the edges.

394
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,800
拉安 你也明白的
You get that, La'An.

395
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,320
我們的傳感器壓根沒探測到這些東西
Not one of those things showed up on our sensors.

396
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,420
但它們看起來非常像活人
But they looked very alive to me.

397
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,010
至少 看起來不像死的
At least, you know, n-not... dead?

398
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:52,220
但無論它們是什麼
Whatever they are,

399
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,460
傳感器並不識別其為生命體徵
they don't register as life signs anymore.

400
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,240
除了我們 這裡死氣沉沉的
We are the only things moving in here.

401
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,284
這可是個藏身的好地方 看
This is as good a place as any to hole up. Look.

402
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,180
如果烏娜按部執行程序的話
If Una's following protocol,

403
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,243
進取號現在就在路上了
the Enterprise is already on its way.

404
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:08,600
我們要找個通訊器
We need to find comms,

405
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,820
複製進取號的加密頻道
clone the Enterprise's encrypted channel,

406
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,340
與他們協商一個撤離點
and then coordinate a rendezvous.

407
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:14,400
通信陣列
The comms array.

408
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:18,100
它在房頂
It's on the roof.

409
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:23,660
不行 上樓得和那些東西戰鬥
No, we'd have to engage with those...

410
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,699
不好聽點說 喪屍們?
For serious lack of a better word, zombies?

411
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:28,091
別這麼叫他們
Don't call them that.

412
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,760
他們曾經是聯邦的科學家
They were once Federation scientists.

413
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,575
和克林貢人
And Klingons.

414
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,320
聽著 我很想知道這兒究竟發生了什麼
Look, I'd really like to find out what happened here.

415
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,926
你可以調出實驗室的數據嗎
Can you recall the lab's data?

416
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,148
查普爾提到的作物
The crops that Chapel mentioned.

417
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,498
他們使用了奇美拉之花中的一種藥劑
They used an agent from the Chimera Blossom

418
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:46,620
並用多年生苔蘚的基因對其進行基因編輯
to modify them with genes from a perennial moss.

419
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,025
這種苔蘚可以在幾乎任何環境下生長
A moss that could live and grow anywhere.

420
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:51,820
它們會休眠 但並不會死亡
It lays dormant but never dies.

421
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:54,640
一種雜交超級作物
A hybrid supercrop.

422
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:58,960
哇 這樣一來能令許多聯邦殖民果腹
Wow. That would feed a lot of Federation colonists.

423
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,280
但事態在克林貢人入侵時急轉直下
Only things went to hell when the Klingons invaded.

424
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,160
他們攻擊了這裡
They attacked.

425
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,300
並無視了安全協議
With no regard for safety protocols.

426
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,860
設施中的每個人都被暴露其中
And everyone in the facility was exposed.

427
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,820
這導致苔蘚基因組滲入人體中
It inserted moss genomes into their bodies.

428
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,060
隨後 這種苔蘚吞噬了它周圍的所有植物
This moss consumes every plant around it...

429
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,460
以實現繁殖
to proliferate.

430
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,340
而這也是它們現在在做的
And now that is what they're doing.

431
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,220
吞噬一切活物
Devouring anything that breathes.

432
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,240
看來就是所謂的僵屍了
That sounds like the "Z" word.

433
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:30,580
等等 我們是不是也在吸著同樣的空氣
Wait, we're breathing that same air.

434
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,260
藥劑早就分解失效了
The agent would have broken down long ago.

435
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,260
現在我知道你看到奇美拉之花的時候
Now I see why you were so careful

436
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,770
為什麼要那麼小心了
about that Chimera Blossom.

437
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,946
別多想
Don't overthink it.

438
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:42,560
約瑟夫
Joseph...

439
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,343
為什麼瑪麗需要接受這樣的
why would Marie need biome engineering?

440
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:47,680
生物雜交工程
Hybridization?

441
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:53,980
史波克和我知道該如何安全使用它
Spock and I know how to use it safely.

442
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,320
好吧 回答我的問題
All right. Answer the question.

443
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,740
你想用什麼基因和她融合
You're gonna hybridize her with what?

444
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,160
克里斯 我不能
Chris, I cannot...

445
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,120
等等 不對勁
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

446
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:08,740
戈恩人?
The Gorn?

447
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,412
這就是你所謂的療法嗎
That's your miracle treatment?

448
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:13,980
你要把瑪麗變成什麼
You're g-going to turn Marie into a-a what?

449
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,300
一個人類和戈恩人的雜交種
A human-Gorn hybrid?

450
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,620
根本不是這樣
It is not that rudimentary.

451
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,760
那就解釋給我聽
Then explain it to me.

452
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,000
我跟你說過了
I already told you,

453
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,340
這是救活她的唯一方法
it is her only chance of survival.

454
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,480
讓我理解一下
Let me understand.

455
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,780
比起清除她身上的戈恩遺傳物質
Instead of ridding her body of the Gorn DNA,

456
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,460
現在反而要讓它永遠留在她體內
you're gonna make it permanent?

457
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,900
你想要對她進行基因改造
You're going to change her?

458
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,640
告訴我
Tell me!

459
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,760
約瑟夫
Joseph...

460
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,007
告訴我 你到底要對她做什麼
Just... what are you going to do to her?

461
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:43,096
這是她自己的選擇 克里斯
It was her decision, Chris.

462
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:46,460
她選擇如此
She chose this.

463
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,147
她不想讓你告訴我
She didn't want you to tell me.

464
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:57,840
所以史波克才主動提出和你一起去
That's why you and Spock wanted to go...

465
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,220
這樣一來我就永遠不會得知
So I would never know.

466
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,160
我的天
Oh, my...

467
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,920
這是救活她的唯一方法
This is the only way to save her.

468
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,060
而這也是我們都想要的結果
And that is what we all want.

469
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,360
這就是你救她的辦法嗎
This is your idea of saving--

470
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,560
還說什麼我們都想要的
Wh-What we all want?

471
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,516
絕對不是
No.

472
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:14,460
再復盤一下
Look again.

473
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,404
再努力努力
Try harder. I...

474
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,560
肯定有別的方法的
There's got to be another way.

475
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,700
她只有幾天時間了
She has a few days.

476
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,440
可能更少
Maybe less.

477
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:25,051
幾天
A few days?

478
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:26,400
她不想讓我知道
She didn't want me to know

479
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,860
她也不想告訴我
and she didn't want to tell me.

480
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,820
為什麼
Why?

481
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,280
我們要被圍堵了
We're gonna get swarmed.

482
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,540
過載槍上的供能線圈
Overload the charging coil.

483
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,656
你們跟我們走
You will come with us.

484
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,940
謝謝你
Thank you.

485
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,040
你是誰呢
Uh, who are you?

486
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,960
拿著裂解槍的人
The one holding a disruptor.

487
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:36,520
走我前面
Ahead of me!

488
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,864
要是走錯一步 你們就都得死
One wrong step and you both die.

489
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,821
好吧
Okay.

490
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,640
至少你不會生吞活剝了我們
At least you're not trying to eat us.

491
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,240
往前走
Forward.

492
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,643
可多虧你把它們搞醒了
Thanks for waking them up.

493
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,500
它們數量太多了
There are too many!

494
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,920
那些是力場發生器
Those are forcefield emitters.

495
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,300
控制台就在正中央
The console's dead center!

496
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:42,666
約瑟夫
Joseph?!

497
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,220
我們能試著把他們引開穿梭機
We could try luring them away from your shuttle,

498
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,900
然後關閉力場逃離
and then lowering the field,

499
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,180
但我們需要武器
but we need weapons.

500
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:11,200
克里斯
Chris!

501
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,380
我真是嘴欠才找你合作
I walked right into that one.

502
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,360
你到底是誰
Who are you?

503
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,280
先說說你是誰吧
First, we talk about you.

504
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,400
我不得不說 當你們的穿梭機越過邊界時
I have to say, when your shuttle crossed the treaty line,

505
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,141
我簡直難以置信
I couldn't believe it.

506
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:24,540
我還以為是我的維瑞迪姆定位器壞了
I thought my viridium tracker was broken.

507
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,520
你在追蹤他?
You were tracking him?

508
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,842
下次隆'戈維亞人請你喝酒的時候
When a R'ongovian offers you a drink,

509
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:29,220
記得別吃掉裡面的橄欖
never eat the olives.

510
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,380
現在你找到我了 但為什麼
Now you found me. Why?

511
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,718
你沒有看見嗎
Do you not see a reflection?

512
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:37,340
一束來自宿敵的目光
The gaze of an old enemy?

513
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,100
我殺了太多克林貢人
I have killed too many Klingons

514
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,000
以至於我都不知道你來自哪個家族
to know which house you're from.

515
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,380
我是拜莎
I am Bytha.

516
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,320
達克'拉赫的女兒 拉烏爾家族的冠軍戰士
Daughter of Dak'Rah, champion of House Rah'Ul.

517
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,518
拉赫大使的女兒
Ambassador Rah's daughter.

518
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,020
約瑟夫·姆'本加
Joseph M'Benga...

519
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,800
我來這是為了讓你為
I am here to make you answer

520
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,980
被你刺殺的克林貢人付出代價
for the Klingon you assassinated.

521
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,898
正在進入肯佛瑞周圍的緩衝區
We are now entering the buffer zone around Kenfori.

522
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,000
這是一種儀式
It's a ritual.

523
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:16,456
上尉 保持七分之一脈衝推力
Lieutenant, keep the ship at one-seventh impulse,

524
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:17,580
但也不要空轉
and not a tick over.

525
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,520
高於此速度會暴露我們的位置
Anything above that will give away our position.

526
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,678
遵命 中校 保持速度
Aye, Commander. Maintaining speed.

527
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:23,071
艦橋呼叫輪機部
Bridge to Engineering.

528
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:24,620
關閉所有非必要系統
Power down all non-essential systems.

529
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:29,060
正在接近克林貢戰列巡洋艦 距離兩百公里
Approaching the battle cruiser at 200 kilometers.

530
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,774
有視訊了
I have a visual.

531
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:39,160
抱歉 龜速之下我很難機動
Sorry. It's hard to maneuver at snail speed.

532
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,220
距離克林貢戰巡一百公里
Battle Cruiser at 100 kilometers.

533
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,140
我們已經遠離克林貢戰巡
We are clear of the Klingon ship.

534
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,020
通訊如何
Comms?

535
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,377
沒有檢測到任何訊息
Not picking up any chatter.

536
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,080
護盾狀態如何
Shields?

537
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,120
仍然關閉 他們看不到我們
Still down. They can't see us.

538
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:17,420
檢測到低溫凝華現象
Detecting frozen volatiles forming.

539
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,080
建議將速度降至八分之一脈衝
Recommend reducing speed to one-eighth impulse.

540
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,040
預計抵達時間修改為六小時
Amending estimated arrival to six hours.

541
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,877
我們必須相信派克和姆'本加
We'll have to trust that Pike and M'Benga are capable enough

542
00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:31,704
能夠再堅持多一會
to hold down their own a little while longer.

543
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,840
上尉 降至八分之一脈衝推力
Lieutenant, one-eighth impulse.

544
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,189
已減速至八分之一
Slowing to one-eighth.

545
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,937
中校 我檢測到一些信號
Commander, I'm picking up something now.

546
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:48,113
是一個監測頻率
It's a monitoring frequency.

547
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,280
他們的傳感器正在啟動
Their sensors are activating.

548
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,300
他們正在將傳感陣列瞄向我艦
They're turning their array toward our ship.

549
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:55,600
中校 我想我們被發現了
Commander, I think we've been spotted.

550
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:03,780
沒事的 我會活下來
It's fine. I'll survive.

551
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,044
夠了 離開他
Enough. Leave him.

552
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,789
冤有頭 債有主 饒了我的朋友吧
Your grievance is with me. Spare my friend.

553
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,443
你錯了
You are wrong.

554
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:18,099
我的冤一直在我父親身上
My grievance has always been with my father,

555
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,800
他是帝國的叛徒
traitor to the empire.

556
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,494
你不是來為他報仇的?
You're not here to avenge him?

557
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:22,780
他是個戰犯
He was a war criminal

558
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,080
也是投降聯邦的走狗
and a lapdog to the Federation.

559
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,260
死有餘辜
I welcomed his death.

560
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,100
原來是克林貢人的血仇
A Klingon blood feud.

561
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,040
達克'拉赫讓我們家族蒙羞
Dak'Rah brought shame to our family name.

562
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,240
因為他的罪
For his sins,

563
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,252
我們家族受盡屈辱
our house has been subject to discommendation.

564
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:43,120
族人被疏遠 血統被唾棄
We are shunned, our bloodline spat upon.

565
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,735
甚至 為了包船來這裡 我不得不卑躬屈膝
I had to grovel just to charter a ship here.

566
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:49,140
只有一種方法可以恢復我們的名譽
There was one way to restore our name.

567
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,420
親手暗殺我的父親
Assassinate my father.

568
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,596
可惡的是 你先殺掉了他
Only, you got to him first.

569
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,720
好吧
Okay.

570
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,836
我們需要保持冷靜
We need to stay calm.

571
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:01,447
她認為殺了我
She thinks killing me

572
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:04,240
會以某種方式恢復她的榮譽
will somehow restore her honor.

573
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,580
除非我手刃刺殺我父親的刺客
Our name remains soiled

574
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,760
否則我們的家族仍將蒙羞
unless I kill my father's assassin.

575
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:10,740
儀式戰鬥?
Ritual combat?

576
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,502
戰鬥至死?
To the death?

577
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:15,939
他沒有暗殺拉赫
He didn't assassinate Rah.

578
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:17,332
他的行為是出於自衛
He acted in self-defense.

579
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:19,160
這個人類說的是實話嗎
Does this human speak the truth?

580
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,620
你的戰士時代已經過去了嗎
Are your warrior days behind you?

581
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:27,500
我只問你一次
I will only ask you once.

582
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,780
你真的暗殺了我父親嗎
Did you assassinate my father?

583
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,871
他們把我們掃描了個遍
Their scanners are all over us.

584
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:36,360
-烏乎拉 -還是什麼也沒有
- Uhura. - Still nothing.

585
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,760
克林貢人沒有回應
The Klingons aren't responding.

586
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,800
繼續嘗試
Keep trying.

587
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,440
告訴他們我們來這裡執行救援任務
Inform them that we are here on a rescue mission.

588
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,940
我們並沒有著陸意圖
We are not attempting to land.

589
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,260
他們還沒有升起護盾
They haven't raised shields yet,

590
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,380
但我建議趁我們還有機會 升起護盾
but I recommend raising ours while we have the chance.

591
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:47,940
不行 這樣會釋放錯誤的信號
No, that sends the wrong message.

592
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,380
為什麼要關心他們的看法
Why do we care what they think?

593
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,840
這毫無意義 如果他們
This is pointless. If they...

594
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,243
說完你的想法 上尉
Finish your thought, Lieutenant.

595
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,640
我只是認為我們已經越過了外交能解決的界限
I just think we're past the point of diplomacy.

596
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,117
你認為向我表達這種擔憂是明智的嗎
And you thought it wise to express that concern to me

597
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:04,620
鑑於我們正在執行命令的過程中?
in the middle of executing orders?

598
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,880
克林貢艦船護盾已升起

599
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,734
克林貢戰巡正在升起護盾並逼近
The Klingons are raising shields and closing in.

600
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,040
中校 是時候交戰了
Commander, time to engage.

601
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,523
執行規避機動 奧特加斯 看你了
Evasive maneuvers. Ortegas, you're up.

602
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:20,352
樂意之至
Gladly.

603
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,575
告訴她真相
Just tell her the truth.

604
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:30,710
我暗殺了拉赫
I assassinated Rah.

605
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,146
-約瑟夫 -我本可以阻止自己
- Joseph... - I could have stopped it.

606
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:34,148
但這個大屠殺兇手給了我
But a mass murderer gave me

607
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:36,542
殺死他的機會
the opportunity to kill him.

608
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,740
我如此做了
And I did.

609
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,148
自願的
Willingly.

610
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,940
如果再有機會 我還會如此
I would do it again.

611
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,291
所以 沒錯
So yes.

612
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,380
他的性命 由我奪取
His blood is on my hands.

613
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:51,948
這是不光彩的嗎
Was that dishonorable?

614
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:53,280
我不清楚
I don't know.

615
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:57,389
但我清楚 那是正義
But there was justice.

616
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,434
我撒謊 是為了掩護
I lied to protect

617
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:01,400
那個仍潛藏於我內心的野獸
the monster that still lives inside me.

618
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,181
若有需要 我會讓他重拾鋒鏑
Should the day come when he is needed again.

619
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:15,060
把刀拿起來
Pick up the blade.

620
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:17,260
直面我
And face me.

621
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,855
約瑟夫
Joseph.

622
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:30,100
別這樣
Don't do this.

623
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,858
我包裡有一個給你的醫療包
There is a med kit for you in my bag.

624
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:33,620
找到辦法離開這個遺棄星球
Find your way off this forsaken planet,

625
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,060
然後把花帶給巴特爾艦長
and get the flower to Batel.

626
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,860
查普爾護士和史波克那裡有我的實驗記錄
Chapel and Spock have my lab notes.

627
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,980
一定有其他方法
There has to be another way.

628
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,860
夠了
Enough!

629
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:43,435
是時候了 你死我活
It is time for one of us to die.

630
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,354
我已經準備好面對我的命運了
I am ready to face my destiny.

631
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:51,720
你呢
Are you?

632
00:37:56,796 --> 00:37:59,581
上面沾有我父親的血
This holds the blood of my father.

633
00:38:00,886 --> 00:38:03,106
把他纏在手上
It binds us.

634
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:06,849
直到它沾滿敗者的鮮血
Until it is stained with the blood of the vanquished.

635
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,481
不
No!

636
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,280
不
No!

637
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,488
你不能棄權
You cannot forfeit!

638
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:23,260
太遲了
Too late.

639
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,520
我今天不需要釋放野獸出來
I do not need the monster today.

640
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,191
輕饒我命
By sparing my life,

641
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,846
是對我的命運下了詛咒 比死了還糟糕
you damn me to a fate worse than death.

642
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,660
這力場要支撐不住了
That field's about to come down.

643
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,163
斯坎內爾中尉 還有多久
Lieutenant Scannell, time?

644
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:44,599
四秒後進入大氣熱層
Thermospheric entry in four seconds.

645
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,300
外部氣體壓縮到80%
Outer gas compression is at 80%.

646
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,255
所以我們基本上算是撞向一堵磚牆
So basically we're flying into a brick wall.

647
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:49,960
別亂想了 堅守崗位
Don't think about it, just hang on.

648
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:00,746
傳送室呼叫艦橋
Transporter to Bridge.

649
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:02,520
你們必須立刻關閉引擎
You need to cut engine power now!

650
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,620
如果你們不補償行星引力
If you don't compensate for planetary gravity,

651
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,840
船會散架的
we will come apart.

652
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,940
收到 中尉 
Copy, Lieutenant. 

653
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,900
你繼續嘗試獲取傳送信號
You work on getting us that transporter signal.

654
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,080
佩利亞早就警告過你別逞強
Pelia warned you not to volunteer.

655
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,759
現在好了 說出去的話就像潑出去的水
And now you actually have to do what you promised.

656
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,825
力場重新上線了 但是它撐不了太久
The field is back up, but it won't hold much longer!

657
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,860
目前你殺了一個
You got one.

658
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,100
你還有心情記分啊
You're keeping score?

659
00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:00,849
聽著
Listen, uh...

660
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:03,280
我們合作 就能都活著逃出去
we work together, we all get out alive.

661
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,620
<i>衝我來</i>

662
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,520
<i>你們這些骯髒的塔格獸</i>

663
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,530
她在吸引喪屍的注意
She's drawing their attention.

664
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,580
為什麼
Why?

665
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:33,534
通過犧牲她自己
By sacrificing herself,

666
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:35,449
她會光榮地死去
she chooses an honorable death.

667
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:36,880
但是沒有人會知道
But no one will ever know.

668
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,640
她會知道
She will know.

669
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,820
我會知道
I will know.

670
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,540
願斯托沃寇歡迎你
May Sto-vo-kor welcome you.

671
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:56,320
快走 到穿梭機上去
Come on, let's get to the shuttle.

10672
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,300
甲板重力層失效

673
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,517
輪機室發出警告
Alert from Engineering!

674
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,880
人工重力正在失效
Artificial gravity is failing

675
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,640
慣性阻尼器效能僅剩20%
and inertial dampeners are at 20%.

676
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,040
如果我們不讓它重新上線
If we don't get it back up...

677
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:11,000
奧特加斯 你能穩定我們的軌道嗎
Ortegas, can you stabilize us?

678
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,460
稍等
In a minute.

679
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,760
傳送室呼叫艦橋
Transport to Bridge.

680
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,580
在艦船軌道塌陷時 很難保持模式完整性
It's a little hard to maintain pattern integrity in orbital collapse.

681
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,640
你們能不能稍微開穩一點
Can you maybe give me a smidge less turbulence?

682
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,860
斯考特 你知道怎麼重新穩定軌道嗎
Mr. Scott, any ideas on how to re-stabilize?

683
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,740
試試交替啟動脈衝引擎
Try firing impulse thrusters in an alternating pattern.

684
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,700
先啟動輔助引擎 再啟動主引擎
Auxiliary first, then the main.

685
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,000
我要開始傳送了
I'm gonna energize.

686
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,800
我真心希望自己不要把
I really hope I don't scramble

687
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,040
艦長和姆'本加醫生混在一起了
the captain and Dr. M'Benga up.

688
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,820
傳送室呼叫艦橋
Transport to Bridge,

689
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,520
艦長和醫官已經傳送登艦
we have the captain and doctor on board.

690
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,360
幹得好 斯考提 我們現在維持在軌道上
Good one, Scotty. We're maintaining orbit now.

691
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,900
中校 我們的通訊受到干擾
Commander, I'm getting interference on our comms.

692
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,960
有東西在阻塞我們的通訊
Something's jamming us.

693
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,880
來源不是星塵帶
It's not from the dust belt.

694
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,800
打開艦尾視訊
Aft viewscreen.

695
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,410
他們正在進入攻擊陣位
They're on an attack course.

696
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,360
奧特加斯
Ortegas?

697
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,280
馬上就好
Already on it.

698
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,080
吃我們的尾氣去吧
Say hi to our dust.

699
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,638
恭喜 各位
Congratulations, everyone.

700
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,220
艾麗卡 相當精彩的飛行
Erica... stellar flying.

701
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,760
但下次別這麼做了
But never do that again.

702
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,560
艦長個人日誌 補充
Captain's personal log, supplemental.

703
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,360
我們已經帶著一朵奇美拉之花
We have returned from our away mission

704
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,800
從外遣任務歸來
with a single Chimera Blossom.

705
00:43:38,355 --> 00:43:40,792
一旦史波克完成了化合物的合成
Once Spock synthesizes its chemical compounds,

706
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:42,620
瑪麗就可以開始接受新療法了
Marie's new therapy can begin.

707
00:43:43,403 --> 00:43:45,640
我好奇這個激進的療法
I wonder what effects this radical treatment

708
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,500
對她會有什麼效果
will have on her.

709
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,847
你會上報我的行徑嗎
Are you going to turn me in?

710
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:58,766
你擔心我會嗎
Are you worried I will?

711
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,641
那取決於我在跟誰說話
That depends on who I'm talking to right now.

712
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,860
是我的朋友
My friend...

713
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,383
還是我的艦長
or my captain?

714
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,038
我理解你為什麼有些事
Look, I understand why you didn't tell me

715
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:11,520
不肯告訴我了
certain things, huh?

716
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,080
我只希望我能早些知道
I just wish I had known some of them sooner.

717
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,020
按照官方說法
Officially, there was

718
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,919
不存在前往肯佛瑞星的任務
no mission to Kenfori.

719
00:44:20,919 --> 00:44:22,640
所以 那裡什麼也沒有發生
So, nothing happened there.

720
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,680
我沒有什麼報告需要提交
I don't have any report to file.

721
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,112
但是如果假設
But if you did,

722
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:30,620
你提交了報告
hypothetically,

723
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,300
裡面會怎麼說
what would it say?

724
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:34,880
會說 有人用刀架在我喉嚨上
That I had a knife to my throat and 

725
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,760
你為了救我 編了一個故事
you told a story to save my life.

726
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,180
那就是事情的經過 有異議嗎
That's what happened, wouldn't you agree?

727
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,240
沒有
I would.

728
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:51,819
你不是一頭野獸 約瑟夫
You're not a monster, Joseph.

729
00:44:54,387 --> 00:44:56,215
只是一個普通人
Just a man.

730
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:58,600
更是我的朋友
And my friend.

731
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,499
怎麼了 你想聊聊嗎
What's up? You wanted to chat?

732
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,899
請就座 上尉
Have a seat, Lieutenant.

733
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:13,667
感覺 很正式啊
Oh, this feels, uh, official.

734
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:17,560
正好在0240時
At precisely 0240 hours,

735
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,480
當我嚴令你保持脈衝引擎推力在八分之一時
you pushed the engines to one-sixth impulse power,

736
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,299
你把它開到了六分之一推力
when I gave you strict orders to keep us at one-eighth.

737
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,552
我在試圖躲避小行星
I was trying to dodge tiny asteroids.

738
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,179
我們當時都很緊張
We were all on edge.

739
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:29,539
我可能有點手滑了
My finger might have slipped a little.

740
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,939
我相信對一般舵手來說
A reasonable error by the standards

741
00:45:31,939 --> 00:45:33,539
這是個合情合理的錯誤
I hold most helm officers to.

742
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:35,080
但你不是一般的舵手
But you're not most helm officers.

743
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,120
你不會犯這樣的錯誤
You don't make mistakes like that.

744
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:40,360
除非你是有意為之
Unless they're intentional.

745
00:45:40,979 --> 00:45:43,305
你逼我做出決定
You forced my hand.

746
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,939
你開得剛好快到能讓我們被克林貢人發現
You flew just fast enough for us to be spotted by the Klingons,

747
00:45:47,939 --> 00:45:51,120
所以我別無選擇 只能轉而執行你的計劃
so I'd have no choice but to switch over to your plan.

748
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,575
看著我的眼睛
Look me in the eye

749
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:54,339
告訴我 我想錯了
and tell me I'm wrong.

750
00:45:57,015 --> 00:45:58,360
你打算讓派克和姆'本加
You were going to leave Pike and M'Benga

751
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,080
被困在下面六個小時
stranded for six hours.

752
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,542
我們都知道克林貢人不收俘虜
We all know the Klingons don't take prisoners.

753
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,000
你可以不同意我的決策
Disagree with me all you want.

754
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,760
但不是你來做出決策
It's not your call to make.

755
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,459
你知道六個小時能發生什麼嗎
Do you know what could happen in six hours?

756
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:15,033
對你的遭遇 我感到很遺憾
I'm sorry about what happened to you, Erica.

757
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:16,720
但是我不能讓這些事影響你的判斷
But I can't have it affect your judgment.

758
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,280
那是個錯誤
It was a mistake.

759
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,760
我能處理好它
I can get a handle on it.

760
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,475
你最好能
You better.

761
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:24,651
派克和姆'本加當時正準備開穿梭機逃走
Pike and M'Benga were about to escape in a shuttle.

762
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:26,300
你耍的花招不必要地威脅到了
So your maneuver endangered

763
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,820
艦上每一個人的安全
everyone on the ship unnecessarily.

764
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,320
我並沒有想危及他們
I never meant to do that.

765
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,619
我知道
I know.

766
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,969
但是你抗命是有後果的
But there are consequences for insubordination.

767
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:40,320
我會把你從輪班表上撤下
I'm pulling you from the duty roster.

768
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,400
兩週時間
Two weeks. 

769
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,180
在此期間內 你需要向准尉報道
In that time, you'll have to report to the warrant officer

770
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,440
進行指揮體系訓練
for Chain-of-Command training.

771
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:53,939
我可以離開了嗎 長官
Am I dismissed, sir?

772
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:00,121
艾麗卡
Erica.

773
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:03,160
什麼事 長官
Yes, sir?

774
00:47:04,259 --> 00:47:06,002
這種事不能再發生了
This can't ever happen again.

775
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,720
你明白嗎
You do realize that, right?

776
00:47:10,899 --> 00:47:11,820
我明白
I do.

777
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:15,136
而且我很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

778
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:32,240
嘿
Hey.

779
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,040
你的腿怎麼樣了 我聽說你受傷了
How's your leg? I heard you got hurt.

780
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,979
沒事了
It's fine.

781
00:47:39,682 --> 00:47:41,249
我想知道為什麼船上除了我以外
I want to know why everyone else on the ship

782
00:47:41,249 --> 00:47:42,240
所有人都知道這件事
seems to know but me.

783
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,780
當那植物把你和幾乎殺死你的物種
Do you have any idea what could happen?

784
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,499
融合在一起的時候
When that plant fuses you with the species

785
00:47:46,499 --> 00:47:47,699
你知道後果可能有多嚴重嗎
that nearly killed you already?

786
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,344
我清楚所有的風險
I know all the risks and...

787
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,819
但我不在乎
I don't care.

788
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:52,040
你對我說謊了
Fine, you lied to me.

789
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,180
我從來沒對你說過謊
I never lied to you.

790
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,120
那你為什麼不告訴我
Then why didn't you tell me?

791
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,500
原因在於你
Because of you.

792
00:47:56,656 --> 00:47:59,820
因為這件事 因為我已經沒有餘裕去顧慮
Because of this, because I don't have the space to worry

793
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,604
我的死會如何讓你難過
about how my dying hurts your feelings.

794
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:14,040
克里斯
Chris?

795
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:17,242
你還有好幾天時間
You had days and...

796
00:48:17,242 --> 00:48:19,592
但你做出了我能想像的
you made what I can only imagine

797
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:21,539
你人生中最艱難的決定
is the hardest decision of your life.

798
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:23,040
我卻沒參與其中
But I wasn't a part of it.

799
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,000
是的 因為這與你無關
 Yeah, because it wasn't about you.

800
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,320
我只希望我有機會能說出所有該說的話
I just wish I'd have had the opportunity to be able to say

801
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,800
有機會告訴你 我會無條件支持你
all the right things, to tell you I'd be there no matter what.

802
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,900
無論你做了什麼決定
No matter what choice you made.

803
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:30,940
如果真是那樣就好了
And that would've been nicer.

804
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,388
但是你知道嗎 你我都心知肚明
But you know what, we both know you and we know

805
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:35,400
你一定會堅持要我們尋找別的辦法
that you would have demanded we find another way.

806
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:40,080
然而並沒有別的辦法了
And there is no other way.

807
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,000
我很害怕 克里斯
I'm scared, Chris.

808
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,357
嘿 過來
Hey, come here.

809
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:46,760
我知道
I know, I know.

810
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:52,494
我也很害怕
I'm scared, too.
